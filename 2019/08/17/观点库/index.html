<h1 id="话题1-政府类：政府职能"><a href="#话题1-政府类：政府职能" class="headerlink" title="话题1: 政府类：政府职能"></a>话题1: 政府类：政府职能</h1><h2 id="政府的职能："><a href="#政府的职能：" class="headerlink" title="政府的职能："></a>政府的职能：</h2><ol>
<li>经济： 促进经济发展。<br>背景：政府被人民选举出来，可以制定比较好的政策去让国家更加富裕，生活更好<br>解释1：投资科技, 效率会提高，产品会更加有竞争力。<br>解释2：  鼓励创业、减税，减少企业的运营成本，  增加就业机会。<br>解释3：加强基础设施建设，运输方便<br>词伙：enforce/formulate policies, rich/econmically developed/prosperous,<br>have competitive advantages<br>set up a business, reduce/cut tax, operation/running cost, create jobs/ generate employment<br>infrastructure investment<br>翻译：To make a country richer is possibly the main duty of the government. The head of the government is elected by the public to enforce policies to grow the economy and improve the standard of living of everybody. The government can achieve this possibly by investing in technology, which can improve the productivity of the workforce and increase the competitiveness of products. Another method is to cut tax to reduce the cost of running and encourage people to set up business, which can create jobs. Finally, it is also important to invest in infrastructure, so it is easier to transport goods to different places to make money.</li>
</ol>
<a id="more"></a>
<ol start="2">
<li>社会环境：维持社会的秩序<br>解释：政府有权立法，规范和制约行为，确保社会不会因为不好的行为而产生动乱。<br>解释2：政府管理军队还有警察，执法部门，确保法律得到执行，确保社会的稳定<br>解释(C的好处)：生活有保障，有幸福感<br>词伙：law-making power, social unrest/havoc/chaos,<br>law enforcement entities/agents,<br>feel safe, a sense of well-being/happiness<br>翻译：The government is also responsible to maintain social order. It has the law-making power to regulate the behaviour of citizens and deter bad behaviour, to prevent social unrest caused by crime and offences. Meanwhile, the government manages military forces and police forces, as well as other law-enforcement agents, to ensure all laws are enacted for social stability. people will have a sense of security in an orderly society and this is important to life satisfaction.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>生活标准：政府要提高社会公平<br>背景：贫富差距增加是建立快乐社会的挑战，穷人会对上层阶级充满敌意。<br>解释：通过资源社会安排，将富人的部分财富分配给穷人，穷人有机会接受教育、享受社会资源。<br>结果：穷人有安全感和幸福感，富人则有安全感，社会安全稳定。<br>词伙：create a fair society, wealth gap/disparity, build  a happy society, upper class, redistribute wealth, a sense of happiness and safety<br>翻译：Creating a fair society is another thing the government should do as it is the key to social stability. The widening wealth gap is possibly the biggest challenge to building a happy society because the disadvantaged are hostile to the upper class. To achieve greater equality, the government can levy  higher tax on the wealthy and can redistribute the wealth to support the people in need.  Even people from deprived backgrounds can be educated to find good jobs, and if they have access to free or low-cost public services, such as medical care, they can set aside money easily for transforming their lives. In this way, the disadvantaged feel a sense of happiness and security while the rich will experience a sense of safety.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>生活标准要提高：花钱在公共服务 和福利上<br>解释： 税收应该取之于民，用之于民。<br>措施：投资医疗服务，人们可以体检，保持健康，有病就治<br>措施：投资教育，提高就业能力<br>措施：交通、公园、娱乐设施，生活方便和丰富<br>词伙：tax revenue, tax is collected from… the interest of the public<br>physical examination, health check-up, stay/keep healthy, cure diseases/recover from illnesses<br>sharpen job skills/ability to find work<br>convenient, enrich one’s life, live a colourful life<br>翻译：Another responsibility of the government is to improve the standard of living of the public, which can be achieved by investing in public services and welfare. Tax can be collected from the public and used for the interests of the masses. The investment in medical services allows people to stay healthy as they can do physical examinations regularly or receive medical treatment when they are ill. The spending on education can improve young people’s ability to find work as they have job skills and knowledge. The expenditure on public transport, parks and recreational facilities can bring convenience to the public, and they can live a colourful life.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>环保：保护生态环境和自然资源。<br>解释： 环境对人的健康有很大的影响，对人的生活质量也有很大影响，对经济也有影响。<br>解释(B-C)：各种污染(空气污染、水污染、垃圾污染)减少，避免一些疾病<br>解释(B-C)：环境保护好(树林、湖泊，海洋等保护很好)，旅游观光，享受各种室外活动<br>解释(B-C)：污染影响原材料，影响经济<br>词伙：natural environment, ecological assets, alleviate pollution, mitigate environmental problems, environmental damage, well preserved, go sightseeing, sustain the economic development<br>翻译：It is also the responsibility of the government to protect the national environment and conserve ecological assets of a country. A well-protected environment has significant implications for the well-being of citizens as well as the sustainability of economic growth. Some projects can be launched to alleviate pollution and mitigate environmental problems, such as air pollution, water contamination and the environmental damage caused by waste, which can eliminate some diseases. If forest, lakes and oceans are well preserved, people can go sightseeing and enjoy a great variety of outdoor activities. Meanwhile, the reduction of pollution can ensure resources such as water and timber are available in abundance for businesses, and the economic development of a country can thus be sustained.</li>

<li>A.  没有钱 B. 他们的生活无法被保障 C. 犯罪<br>背景：国家没有好的福利系统，保证不了基本的生活<br>解释(B-C)：为了活命<br>举例：打劫、盗窃和卖毒品<br>词伙：commit crime 犯罪<br>benefits system 福利系统<br>maintain a basic standard of living 维持基本的生活标准<br>get money to make a living 获得钱<br>翻译：One reason why some people commit crime is that they do not have a job or any source of income. If the country does not have a good benefits system, they will not be able to maintain a basic standard of living.  They have to commit crimes, such as robberies, theft or selling drug, to get money to make a living.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>A贫富差异 B 因为他们觉得不公平 C 报复社会<br>背景：贫富差距越来越大，国家没有帮助穷人的机制<br>解释(B-C)：人们感觉非常不公平，十分愤怒<br>解释(B-C)：穷人感到绝望，他们维持不了基本生活，所以就会犯罪。<br>词伙：economic divide, a wide gap between rich and poor, economic disparity, 贫富差距<br>feel unfair, inequitable 感觉不公平，不平等<br>anti-social behaviour 反社会行为<br>翻译：The widening gap between rich and poor may also lead to some criminal activity as people feel unfair and resentful. The country does not have policies of income redistribution to use part of the wealth of the upper class to support those living on low income. Disadvantaged people feel hopeless, as they struggle with basic needs. They may commit offences, such as damaging public properties, to vent their anger.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>行为:<br>A 教育忽视小孩的行为，获得 教育机会有限  B 不知道行为标准   C  犯罪<br>背景：他们可能是贫困出身或者不知道什么是好行为和不好的行为。<br>解释(A-B)：他们辍学，没有学习任何的法律法规。<br>解释(B-C)：他们也不知道他们犯了会有什么后果，低估了犯罪的后果。<br>词伙：limited access to education没有机会接受教育<br>behavioural norms行为准则<br>翻译：Another main reason is that people do not have access to education and they do not know behavioural norms. They may be from deprived backgrounds and unaware of what is right or wrong behaviour. They may leave school early without attending lessons to learn about laws. They do not know what consequences they will have to face if they break the law, or underestimate the consequences of committing crimes.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>行为：<br>A 基因 B 决定了脾气性格 等   C 犯罪<br>解释(A-B )： 某些人大脑掌管情绪的部分有缺陷<br>解释(B -C )：比较容易动怒，缺乏通情的能力<br>词伙：manage emotions掌控情绪<br>lose temper发脾气,<br>empathise with…理解别人的感受<br>show empathy 通情<br>翻译：Genetics can be a predictor of criminal behaviour as it determines one’s temperament and character. One section of the human brain is responsible for managing emotions, but some people are born to suffer from some emotion-handling deficit. They have difficulty in controlling anger and in empathising with others. This is why they are predisposed to violence.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>家庭：<br>A 家庭的疏忽，B 他们可能没有获得家庭的关心和照顾，没有管教 C 犯罪<br>背景：家长太忙了<br>解释(A-B)：犯罪的人没有学习行为规范，因为家长太忙了没时间教他们规则的重要性<br>解释(A-B)：孩子可能在学校有不良行为，比如说霸凌，对同班同学大吵大闹，甚至引起更严重的攻击<br>词伙：negligent parents 不好好管理孩子的父母<br>discipline children 管教孩子<br>offensive behaviour 攻击的行为<br>law-breaker 犯罪分子<br>inappropriate behaviour，behave poorly不端行为<br>翻译：Negligent parents are also to blame for the offensive behaviour of the younger generation. The law-breakers may not learn boundaries of behaviour in formative years, possibly because their parents are too busy to teach rules or not aware of the importance of discipline. Children may behave poorly at school, and inappropriate behaviour such as bullying, yelling at classmates and cursing eventually evolves into serious offences, if not corrected by adults.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>媒体：<br>A 接触暴力的信息 B 模仿 C 犯罪<br>解释(A-B)：暴力的行为，发泄情绪<br>解释(A-B)：低估暴力的行为的影响<br>词伙：violent content/image 暴力的内容，图片<br>copy aggressive behaviour/acts of violence 模仿攻击性行为/暴力行为<br>release emotions 释放情绪<br>overlook consequences 忽视后果<br>翻译：The increased exposure to violence in the media is possibly another factor contributing to crime. People play games and watch films which contain violent imagery. They may gradually recognise violence as an acceptable way of releasing negative emotions and settling conflicts, or they may overlook the consequences of acting violently.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="预防犯罪的方法："><a href="#预防犯罪的方法：" class="headerlink" title="预防犯罪的方法："></a>预防犯罪的方法：</h2><ol>
<li>A 刑罚 b  震慑 C 减少犯罪<br>解释(A-B)：刑法让人们有可能没有自由，所以他们会三思后行<br>解释 (B-C)：他们不想待在监狱里面，不能过正常的生活，因此选择不犯罪<br>词伙：a prison sentence/term, 坐牢<br>have a deterrent effect, deter crime  对犯罪有震慑作用<br>翻译：A prison sentence can be an effective way to reduce crime, as it can serve as a deterrent for those would-be law-breakers. The likelihood of losing freedom can make people think twice before violating laws. Some of them will not risk spending a number of months in jail without living a normal life, thereby choosing to obey laws.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>A 教育 B 提高就业能力 C 减少犯罪<br>解释(A-B): 教育让孩子理解可接受的和好的行为，向老师学校规则，教科书和指导<br>解释(A-B)：一个受过教育的人能找到令人满意的工作，如果他们能获得高分，过得舒适，就不会犯罪了。<br>词伙：improve employability 提高教育能力<br>better employment outcomes更好的就业结果<br>翻译：The most desirable preventative measure against crime is possibly education, as schools improve skills and impart the code of conduct. Children can have a good understanding of acceptable and desirable behaviour, learning from school rules, textbooks and instructions of teachers. More importantly, well-educated people can find a satisfying job easily, if they achieve high grades at school and gain a university degree. If they live comfortably, they will never think of committing crime.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>A 社区服务(适合初犯、小的犯罪，青少年犯罪)  B 提升责任感，避免犯罪记录的影响  C 减少犯罪<br>背景：社区服务适合年轻的罪犯，初犯，青少年罪犯<br>解释(A-B)：通过做社区服务，比如：打扫街道，清除涂鸦。他们会有成为社区一员的骄傲感。<br>解释(A-B)：这种方式不会阻碍罪犯的事业，因为他们还能继续上学，也能像其他没犯罪的人一样找到工作。<br>词伙：first-time offenders初犯,<br>petty crimes 轻微罪行<br>juvenile delinquency 青少年犯罪<br>foster a sense of responsibiity 提高责任感<br>criminal record 犯罪记录<br>翻译：Community service is possibly a solution to crime as it fosters a sense of responsibility and minimises the consequences of a criminal record on one’s career. This is ideal for first-time offenders, lawbreakers under the age of 18 and those who commit petty crimes. By doing unpaid work for community, such as cleaning streets and removing grafitti, they will develop a sense of pride as meaningful members of community. Meanwhile, this kind of punishment does not threaten their career as they can still attend school and find work like law-abiding citizens. This can prevent re-offending.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>A  提升保安措施 B 震慑犯罪 C 减少犯罪<br>解释(A-B)：装摄像头可以震慑人们犯罪，因为他们会被摄像头拍下来，作为成功起诉的证据。<br>解释(A-B)：如果警察在街上巡逻，尤其是携带武器，可以对罪犯起震慑作用。<br>词伙：surveillance cameras 摄像头<br>security cameras 监视摄像头<br>increase visibility of police officers 增加警察的可视性<br>arming the police 武装警察<br>equipping the police with weapons 警察携带武器<br>翻译：The improvement of security measures is another method to fight crime. The increase in surveillance cameras can deter people from breaking laws, as their images caught by cameras are used as evidence for successful prosecution. If more police officers patrol on streets, especially when equipped with weapons, it can also have a deterrent effect on offenders. People would understand that they cannot get away with the offences they commit.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="刑罚的好处："><a href="#刑罚的好处：" class="headerlink" title="刑罚的好处："></a>刑罚的好处：</h2><ol>
<li>震慑犯罪，减少犯罪率<br>词伙：have a deterrent effect on potential criminals, reduce crime<br>翻译：Imprisonment has a deterrent effect on potential criminals. It is an effective method to reduce crime.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>保护守法的公民，不会受到犯人的侵害，特别是那些累犯(很难改变他们的行为)<br>词伙：protect law-abiding citizens, recidivist, reform their behaviour<br>翻译：Keeping criminals in prison can help protect law-abiding citizens from crime, especially the harm inflicted by recidivists, who cannot be reformed easily.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="教育和培训-或者只是做社工-的好处："><a href="#教育和培训-或者只是做社工-的好处：" class="headerlink" title="教育和培训(或者只是做社工)的好处："></a>教育和培训(或者只是做社工)的好处：</h2><ol>
<li>提高技能，他们可以找工作，重复犯罪的可能性减少，特别是对于年轻人i<br>词伙：improve job skills, find jobs, be less likely to reoffend, the younger generation<br>翻译：Young offenders who have opportunities to improve job skills can find jobs despite having a history of bad behaviour. They are less likely to reoffend.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>减少和一些累犯的接触，年轻人<br>词伙：avoid contact with repeat offenders<br>翻译：This can prevent their contact with repeat offenders.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>让罪犯懂得法律责任和社会责任，以后重复犯罪的机会下降<br>词伙：be aware of legal and social responsibility, violate laws<br>翻译：People who know legal and social responsibilities are less likely to violate laws.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>避免犯罪记录对年轻人以后重入社会产生影响<br>词伙：reduce the impact of the criminal record on young people, reintegrate into society<br>翻译：Another advantage of education and training is that it can reduce the impact of the criminal record on young people when they attempt to reintegrate into society.</li>

<li>知识<br>A 提供知识和信息  B  改变人们的态度，以教育他们做出正确的选择  C  影响人们的行为<br>背景：有些人不知道什么是正确的行动，通过提供知识和信息告知他们如果他们不采取正确的行动，他们将面临什么后果。<br>解释A-B:如果他们能在学校和媒体上获得信息，就可以教育他们做出正确的选择。<br>举例：在学习如何以环保的方式处理废物之前，他们应该了解回收尽可能多的废物对环境的重要性，以及在海滩上乱扔垃圾对海洋生物的威胁。<br>词伙：give information    提供信息<br>change their attitude    改变态度<br>take the right action   采取正确的行动<br>face the consequences    面对结果<br>make the right choice    做出正确的选择<br>gain access to information    获取信息<br>drop litter   丢垃圾<br>marine life    海洋生物<br>dispose of waste    处理废物<br>翻译：The government influences people’s behavior by giving information and changing their attitude. Some people do not know what is the right action and what consequences they face if they do not take the right action. They can be educated to make the right choice if they gain access to information at school and in the media. For example, they should understand the importance of recycling as much waste as possible to the environment, and the threat of dropping litter on beach to marine life, before learning how to dispose of waste in responsible ways.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>法律<br>A 政府制定和执行法律   B 人们很难克制自己的行为    C 规范行为<br>解释(A-B)：在某些情况下，人们很难控制自己的行为，即使他们意识到自己行为的后果，他们也很难表现出自我克制。<br>解释(B-C)：为了遏制这种行为，政府可以通过严格的法律。<br>词伙：make laws   制定法律<br>enforce laws   执行法律<br>manage their behaviour   管理自己的行为<br>show self-restraint    表现出自我克制<br>be detrimental to health    对健康有害<br>curb such behaviour    遏制这种行为<br>pass strict laws    通过严格的法律<br>impose a tax on tobacco and alcohol    对烟酒征税<br>翻译：Governments can regulate behavior by making and enforcing laws. It is difficult for people to manage their behaviour in some cases, even though they realise the consequences of what they do. They have difficulty in showing self-restraint, such as stopping smoking and overdrinking, although it is common knowledge that these habits are detrimental to health. To curb such behaviour, the government can pass strict laws, for example, imposing a tax on tobacco and alcohol.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>经济方面的激励<br>A 政府提供经济方面的奖励           C 鼓励良好的行为<br>背景：改变行为有时需要投资，而政府的支持可以降低改变行为的经济成本。<br>(A-B)有时打破老的习惯可能是不方便和困难的，所以人们应该得到一些经济奖励。<br>举例：政府可以为购买环保设备的公司提供一些财务优惠，为购买电动汽车等环保产品的消费者提供一些现金奖励。<br>举例2：如果政府希望人们乘坐公共汽车或火车而不是开车，降低公交票价<br>词伙：financial incentives    经济激励措施<br>reduce the economic cost    降低经济成本<br>financial concessions    减费优待<br>eco-friendly equipment    环保设备<br>cash rewards   现金奖励<br>purchase green products    购买环保产品<br>electric cars    电动汽车<br>break the old routine    打破常规<br>financial rewards    经济方面的奖励<br>翻译：Governments can encourage good behaviour by offering financial incentives. Changing behaviour sometimes requires investment, and government support can reduce the economic cost of a shift to new behaviour. For example, the government can provide some financial concessions for companies which buy eco-friendly equipment, and some cash rewards for consumers who purchase green products, such as electric cars. Meanwhile, sometimes breaking the old routine can be inconvenient and difficult so people deserve some financial rewards. For example, if the government wants people to travel by bus or train rather than by car, it makes sense to lower bus fares to promote such behaviour change.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>科技<br>A 对科技的投资   B 技术创新   C 鼓励人们养成一些新的习惯<br>解释(A-B)：除非政府愿意为科学家的研究项目买单，否则技术创新是不可能实现的，因为需要很多时间和金钱<br>举例：政府资助太阳能项目，很多年之后，太阳能才可以商业使用。<br>词伙：establish some new habits    养成新的习惯<br>research projects   研究项目<br>a massive cost    巨大花费<br>solar power    太阳能<br>government funding    政府资助<br>renewable energy    可再生能源<br>clean energy    清洁能源<br>翻译：The investment in technology and science can also encourage people to establish some new habits. Technological innovations are not attainable unless the government is willing to pay for the research projects of scientists,  which can last for decades and incur a massive cost. For example, it took years to make solar power financially viable for individuals and organisations to use, and government funding can ensure the running of those projects intended for the development of such renewable energy. Without technological change, the transition to clean energy would be impossible.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>生活方式<br>A 设施 B 某些行为更加方便 C 改变行为<br>解释(A-B)：身边的环境对我们生活的许多方面都有直接的影响，比如休闲活动。<br>举例：政府可以建造设施(譬如说公园和体育中心)激发人们对户外活动的兴趣。<br>词伙：reshape people’s behaviour    重塑人们的行为<br>leisure activities    休闲活动<br>generate interest    引起人们的兴趣<br>outdoor activities    户外活动<br>sports centers    体育中心<br>recreational facilities    娱乐设施<br>翻译：The government can also invest in facilities that can reshape people’s behaviour. The physical environment has a direct impact on many aspects of our lives, such as leisure activities. In order to generate interest in outdoor activities, for instance, the government can build more parks, sports centers and recreational facilities in cities.</li>

<li>法律<br>A  人们有时会受到自身利益的驱使  B 做一些不道德甚至非法的事情  C 政府限制人们行为<br>背景：人们有时会受到自身利益的驱使。他们做一些不道德甚至非法的事情，因为他们可以从这种行为中获得利益。只有外部的限制才能阻止他们重复这种行为。<br>举例：一些广告商为了赚钱对他们的产品做出虚假的宣传，所以政府应该惩罚这种行为。<br>词伙：be driven by self-interest    被利益驱使<br>external restrictions    外部限制<br>repeat such behaviour    重复这种行为<br>make money    赚钱<br>punish this kind of behaviour    惩罚这种行为<br>翻译：One reason why governments need to influence people’s behavior is that people are sometimes driven by self-interest. They do something unethical or even illegal as there is something they can gain from such behaviour. In these instances, only external restrictions can stop them from repeating such behaviour. For example, some advertisers make false claims about their products to make money, so the government should punish this kind of behaviour.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>个人行为<br>A 有些人缺乏自律   B 不遵循一些行为规范  C 政府干预<br>解释(A-B)：随心所欲地生活是他们天性的一部分，而不是遵循一些行为规范。<br>解释(B-C)：政府干预可以告诉他们行为的界限。<br>词伙：regulate people’s behavior   规范人们的行为<br>follow some behavioural norms    遵循一些行为准则<br>government intervention    政府干预<br>boundaries of behaviour   行为的界限<br>eat fast food    吃快餐<br>cook a meal themselves    自己做饭<br>promote healthy eating    提倡健康饮食<br>tax fast food    对快餐征税<br>翻译：The reason why the government needs to regulate people’s behavior is that some people are not self-disciplined enough. It is part of their nature to live their lives as they please, rather than follow some behavioural norms, and government intervention can tell them boundaries of behaviour.  For example, people like eating fast food, which is tasty and convenient, rather than cooking a meal themselves, which is time-consuming. In order to promote healthy eating, the government can tax fast food.</li>

<li>经济<br>A 政府规范公民行为 B 减少费用 C 对经济有帮助<br>解释(A-B)：坏习惯对经济是有影响的，而通过规范公民行为可以防止一些不必要的成本,减少开支。<br>举例：例如吸烟、酗酒和过着不运动的生活，这些都会增加医疗成本，并导致高的公共医疗支出。<br>词伙：regulate citizens’ behaviour    规范人们的行为<br>benefit the economy     有益于经济<br>prevent some unnecessary costs    避免不必要的开支<br>lead an inactive life    过着消极的生活<br>increase medical costs    增加医疗开支<br>expenditure on healthcare    医疗保健支出<br>break these unhealthy habits    破除这些不健康的习惯<br>medical facilities    医疗设施<br>翻译：Regulating citizens’ behaviour can benefit the economy as it can prevent some unnecessary costs. Bad habits can be problematic in economic terms. Examples include smoking, alcoholism and leading an inactive life, which can increase medical costs and lead to high levels of public expenditure on healthcare. If people break these unhealthy habits, they can enjoy an improvement of health condition and the government can cut the spending on hospitals and medical facilities.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>A 改变行为 B 大家遵守规则  C 社会和谐<br>解释(A-B)：法律和规章通常是根据公众对什么是好的和可取的行为的看法制定的。<br>解释(B-C) ： 禁止不好的行为，人们会表现得彬彬有礼、尊重他人。这是社会凝聚力与和谐的关键。<br>词伙：maintain order of society    维持社会秩序<br>obey rules    遵守规则<br>follow behavioural norms    遵守行为规范<br>yell at others    对别人大吼大叫<br>smoke in public places    在公共场合抽烟<br>road raging    道路暴力<br>sexual harrassment    性骚扰<br>physical assaults   身体攻击<br>social cohesion   社会凝聚力<br>翻译：It is also easy to maintain order of society if people obey rules and follow behavioural norms. Laws and regulations are normally developed based on public perceptions of what is good and desirable behaviour. Behaviours such as yelling at others, smoking in public places, road raging, sexual harrasment and physical assaults are forbidden, and people will act as polite and respectful individuals. This is the key to social cohesion and harmony.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>行为<br>A 改变行为 B 大家觉得有约束 C 生活不自由<br>背景： 人们天生追求生活中的最大程度的自由，他们的生活习惯和生活方式显示出他们的需求、偏好、个性特征以及认同感。<br>解释(B-C)：他们被要求遵守一些规则，他们必须放弃一些他们从中获得快乐的东西。<br>词伙：pursue maximum freedom    追求最大程度的自由<br>personality traits   性格特点<br>sense of identity   认同感<br>public transport    公共交通<br>翻译：Restrictive laws and rules can however limit freedom. People are hardwired to pursue maximum freedom in their lives, and their habits and ways of living show their needs, preferences, personality traits as well as the sense of identity. If they are required to follow some rules, they have to give up something from which they derive pleasure, such as listening to music on public transport without wearing headphones.</li>

<li>收入<br>A 聘用女性 B 做某些工作更好 C 增加企业的效益<br>解释(A-B)：女性有一些品质，例如同情心，意味着她们更乐意去倾听别人，理解别人的感受，处理别人的负面情绪。<br>解释(A-B)：这有可能是因为女性在护理和儿童早教这一类的职业数量很多，而这种职业会要求她们去注意儿童的情感需要。<br>对比(A-B)：反之，男性对他人的情绪就不怎么敏感。<br>解释(B-C)：如果一个公司知人善用，那么员工就会提供给顾客卓越的服务，那么这个公司就会提升收益。<br>词伙：a wise decision 一个明智的决定<br>in some industries 在某些行业里<br>in some positions 在某些职业上<br>deal with negative emotions 处理负面情绪<br>emotional needs 情感需要<br>deliver exceptional services 提供卓越的服务<br>翻译：Hiring women can be a wise decision for companies in some industries, as they outperform men in some positions. Women seem to have some qualities such as empathy, meaning that they are more willing to listen to others, understand the feelings of others and do something to deal with the negative emotions experienced by others. This is possibly why they outnumber men in occupations such as nursing and early childhood education, in which they expect to be attentive to the emotional needs of children. In contrast, men appear to be less sensitive to moods of others. A company is more likely to make profits if it puts the right persons in the right positions and its employees can deliver exceptional services to customers.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>收入<br>A 聘用女性 B 促进创新 C 企业收入增加<br>解释(A-B)：女性与男性有着不同的生活方式，不同的家庭角色以及对人与人之间的关系的不同理解，所以她们可以在产品设计和服务上提出建议<br>举例(A-B)：例如，在健身器材公司上班的女性会建议如何让产品去融入职业女性的日常生活，还有那些有家庭的人<br>解释(B-C)：她们的视角能够让公司去服务更广的人群，从而增加销量<br>词伙：increase a company’s revenue 增加公司收入<br>give a new perspective 提供新的视角<br>in terms of 关于<br>interpersonal relationships 人与人之间的关系<br>serve a broader spectrum of users 服务更广的人群<br>grow sales 增加销量<br>翻译：Having a diverse workforce can also explore some new possibilities of increasing a company’s revenue as women can give a new perspective. Women differ from men in terms of ways of life, the roles they play in family and the understanding of interpersonal relationships, so they can possible give some advice about the design of products or services. For example, women who work for a producer of fitness equipment may give some opinions about how products can fit into the lives of busy working women, and the lives of people who have a family. Their views may provide employers with some opportunities to serve a broader spectrum of users and grow sales.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>生活水准<br>A 聘用女性 B 获得收入 C 让家人生活更好<br>背景：传统来说，一位母亲就应该待在家里养育孩子，父亲则是养家糊口<br>背景：然而，现在这种观念已经改变，因为女性有了受教育的机会，而且工作市场里也有了更多的文员工作，她们便可以进入职场<br>解释(B-C)：随着生活费用的提高，她们的收入对家庭也很重要<br>词伙：in the workforce 在职场<br>bring up the children 养育小孩<br>breadwinner 养家糊口的人<br>have the access to education 有接受教育的机会<br>clerical jobs 文员工作<br>cost of living 生活费用<br>on the rise 在上升<br>翻译：Another advantage of having more females in the workforce is that they can supplement family income. Traditionally, a mother was thought to stay at home and bring up the children and it is the father that should act as the breadwinner of the family. However, now this attitude has changed, as women have the access to education and there are more clerical jobs in the market, they can now enter the workforce. Their income can be important to their family, as the cost of living is on the rise.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>社会文化<br>A 聘用女性 B 让女性有更多机会打破性别成见 C 推进男女平等<br>解释(A-B)：因为当更多的女性进入职场，她们便有潜力去展示她们的能力并且就任高层职位<br>解释(A-B)：她们的成就可以激励更多女性去读大学和追求事业<br>解释(B-C)：如果更多女性承担领导角色，她们的成就能够获得异性的尊重，那么这可以帮助解决在全世界的职场性别歧视问题以及缩小男女收入差距<br>词伙：advance women’s rights 提升女性权益<br>well-qualified 具备资格的<br>break sex stereotypes 打破性别偏见<br>top jobs 高层职位<br>attend university 上大学<br>pursue a profession 追求事业<br>tackle gender discrimination 解决性别歧视问题<br>close the gender pay gap 缩小男女收入差距<br>assume leadership roles 担任领导角色<br>翻译：Increasing the number of female employees can also advance women’s rights by giving well-qualified women more opportunities to break sex stereotypes. As more women enter the job market, they have the potential to show their competence and fill more top jobs. Their achievements can encourage more young women to attend university and pursue a profession. It can tackle gender discrimination in the world of work and close the gender pay gap, if more women assume leadership roles and their performance gains respect from the opposite gender.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>家庭生活<br>A 聘用女性 B 更少的时间陪家人 C 家庭关系不好<br>解释(A-B)：她们必须加班加点地工作，如果她们想要晋升公司高层并且展示她们的才华<br>解释(A-B)：她们必须要牺牲和家庭一起的时间，用来工作，以增长阅历和提高能力<br>解释(B-C)：这样她们和孩子伴侣的关系就会疏远<br>解释(B-C)：为家人不支持她们的工作，那么就会发生家庭争吵<br>词伙：employment opportunities 就业机会<br>balance work and family life 平衡工作和家庭生活<br>work long hours 加班加点地工作<br>climb up the corporate ladder  晋升公司高层<br>increase experience 增长阅历<br>improve skills 提高能力<br>翻译：Offering women employment opportunities can sometimes put them in a situation where they need to balance work and family life effectively. They have to work long hours if they intend to climb up the corporate ladder and display their talents. They have to sacrifice the time with family to work to increase experience and improve skills. This may weaken their bonding with children and marriage partners. Family quarrels can increase as their work is not supported by family.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>A 聘用女性 B 表现不是很好 C 影响公司<br>解释(A-B)：女性不如男性强壮，所以公平地说，她们在某些工作上表现不行或者根本无法达到要求，比如说服兵役，消防工作和警察<br>解释(B-C)：她们的存在很可能会让同事陷入不利的局面，例如，追捕罪犯和执行作战任务。<br>在这些工作上很难实现性别平等<br>词伙：biological challenges 生理挑战<br>it is fair to say 公平地说<br>serve the army 服兵役<br>fire brigades 消防队<br>chase criminals 追捕罪犯<br>accomplish combat missions 执行作战任务<br>achieve gender equality 实现性别平等<br>翻译：Some organisations may have to consider the biological challenges women have to face in some contexts. Women are not as strong as men, so it is fair to say that they would not perform well or even meet standards in some jobs, such as serving the army, working for fire brigades and joining the police forces. Their presence may put their colleagues at a disadvantage in some situations, for example, when chasing criminals and accomplishing some combat missions. It is not easy to achieve gender equality in these jobs.</li>

<li>收入<br>A 聘用女性 B 对女性员工没有足够的尊重 C 员工没有士气<br>解释(A-B)：女性很难获得晋升<br>解释(A-B): 收入不公平<br>词伙：show respect to 尊重<br>unfair treatment不公平的对待<br>domestic responsibilities 家庭责任<br>maternity leave 产假<br>Income disparity 收入不公平<br>翻译：Recruiting women is possibly a tough decision for some employers who may not be able to show sufficient respect to female employees, and women in the workplace sometimes are demotivated by unfair treatment. Companies hardly prepare women for senior positions, as employers have doubts about women’s commitment to work. Women have to spend time in domestic responsibilities and maternity leave means that they can be away from the workplace for several months, which can affect the running of the company.  Income disparity is another issue: women sometimes feel unfair as they receive less pay than their male colleagues working in the same position.</li>

<li>经济：老年人可能对经济有一定帮助。<br>解释：可以推迟退休，要求的薪水可能不高<br>解释2：经验可以帮助雇主解决很多问题<br>词伙：postpone retirement, contribute wisdom, labour cost<br>翻译：Elderly people may be an asset to a country in economic terms. They may postpone retirement. In order to stay in the workforce, they may not ask for high pay. This means that it can reduce the labour cost of many companies.

<li>科技：A预期寿命的提高 B 人们能够增进知识 C 对社会是有益的。解释(A-B)1：他们可以继续他们的研究项目，并在他们的职位上获得新的知识。解释(A-B)2：他们也可以增加知识和建立专业知识:。解释(B-C ):知识是创新的源泉，因为他们将新知识应用于解决一些问题，或开发一些具有新发现的创新产品或服务。<br>词伙：impart knowledge to young people, share experience, improved life expectancy, achieve more success<br>翻译：The improvement of life expectancy also allows people to advance knowledge, which is of benefit to society. They may continue their research projects and gain new knowledge in their positions. It is also possible for them to increase knowledge and build expertise as they have a longer working life. Knowledge is a source of innovation, as they apply new knowledge to solving some problems or develop some innovative products or services with new discoveries.</li>

<li>经济：A老龄化 B 青年劳动力的减少  C 对经济造成压力<br>解释(A-B)：人口老龄化通常伴随着低出生率，因为人们知道他们可以活很久，他们倾向于推迟生育。这通常意味着进入劳动市场的年轻人数量将会下降。<br>解释(A-B)：另外一个原因是老年人可能70岁还在工作，留下更少的工作岗位给年轻人。<br>解释(B-C)：没有精力充沛且高效率的劳动力，这些公司可能不能盈利，对这个国家的经济发展是一个威胁。<br>词伙：medical care, elderly-care facilities, pensions, increase spending, add a burden<br>翻译：One problem of population ageing is that it might damage the country’s economy as the shortage of young workers will be a problem. Population ageing is normally accompanied by a lower birth rate, as people understand they will live a longer life, they tend to delay parenthood. This normally means that the number of young people entering the workforce will drop. Another reason is that elderly people may stay in their positions even in their seventies, leaving fewer jobs available for young jobseekers.  Without  an energetic, creative and highly productive workforce, these companies may be unable to make profits, posing a threat to the economic progress of a country.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>生活标准：A老龄化 B 它可能给医疗服务，老年护理设施和养老金体系带来压力 C 生活标准下降<br>解释(A-B)：医疗需求通常在老年出现，老年人更容易得一些和年龄相关的疾病，比如中风，糖尿病和心脏病，这些会花很多钱。这意味着政府需要投资更多资金于医疗系统。<br>解释(A-B)：需要建更多养老院来去服务那些日常生活有困难的老年人，而且更多的税收应该被用于养老金，这会给纳税人带来压力。<br>词伙：medical care, elderly-care facilities, pensions, increase spending, add a burden<br>翻译：Another major challenge of this trend is that it may put a strain on medical services, elderly care facilities and the pension scheme of a  country. Medial needs normally appear in later years and senior citizens are prone to some ageing-related diseases such as stroke, diabetes and heart diseases, which would cost a large amount of money. This means governments have to pour more funds into medical facilities. Meanwhile, more nursing homes should be built to serve the elderly who experience difficulties in their daily lives, and more tax revenue should be allocated to pensions, which can add a burden on taxpayers. Both people in the workforce and retired people have to accept a poor standard of living if the tax revenue dwindles and the government has to charge higher tax.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>家庭: A老人增加 B 抚养老人负担大  C 增加家庭矛盾。<br>背景：老年人更容易患有一些慢性疾病如痴呆,这意味着他们可能很难照顾好自己，独立生活,所以他们需要他们孩子的支持。<br>背景2：这个任务很大，年轻人不得不靠高薪养家糊口。<br>拓展C：这可能会导致争吵，破坏家庭关系，并损害老年人的心理健康。<br>词伙：the labour shortage, damage the economy<br>翻译：Another positive effect of population ageing is that this can result in tensions between family members if young people spend too much time looking after their parents. Elderly people are more likely to suffer from some chronic diseases such as dementia， which means that they may find it difficult to take good care of themselves and live independently, so they need the support of their children. This can be a daunting task for young people, who have to earn high salaries to feed the whole family.

If they do not withdraw from the workforce, they can continue to earn money, rather than rely on pensions. With salaries, they would be able to maintain a decent standard of living. Meanwhile, staying in a job means that people can stay physically and mentally active, as they need to travel to and from work every day and spend time networking. This can also reduce the chance of suffering from some medical conditions, and this means that the government can cut the expenditure on medical care as well.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>家庭：<br>A老龄化 B老年人 选择他们的孩子住在一起享受家庭生活  C 政府不需要担心照顾他们。<br>解释(B-C)：与其他家庭成员一起生活，可以消除孤独感，与家人交谈，享受家庭生活，有利于退休人员的心理健康。<br>解释(B-C)：老家庭成员也可以承担一些家庭责任，包括洗衣服，扫地和做饭，这可以大大减轻成年人的工作负担。这可能可以保护老年人免受一些身体或情绪健康问题。<br>C的拓展：他们过着幸福、健康的生活，政府将会在医疗服务上花费更少的钱。<br>词伙：<br>翻译：Elderly people can also choose to live with their children to enjoy family life，so the government does not have to worry about looking after them. Living with other members of family can combat the sense of lonelines, and talking with family as well as enjoying family life is beneficial to mental health of retired people. Old family members could also take some domestic responsibilities including doing laundry, sweeping the floor and cooking, which can greatly ease the burden on working adults. This can possibly protect them from some physical or emotional problems they could experience as they age. As they live a happy, healthy life, the government would spend less money on health services.</li>

<li>生活标准：A 人们注意储蓄和交社保 B 年老的时候生活标准不下降 C 解决老龄化的难题<br>解释(A-B)：储蓄买房子，老了就不用交租，也可以通过利息来支付生活费<br>解释(A-B)： 加入国家的养老金计划，退休了可以获得钱<br>词伙：save money for retirement ， set aside money, maintain a reasonable quality of life in the old age<br>buy a home, bank savings, pay rent<br>翻译：Another method is to encourage people to save money for retirement and enrol in the pension scheme of the government, so they have sufficient money to maintain a reasonable quality of life in the old age. They set aside money to buy a home, so they do not need to pay rent when they get old. They also use the interest income of their bank savings to cover the cost of living. As they contribute part of their income to the pension scheme, they can withdraw a proportion of money when they retire. All these efforts can reduce the cost of looking after an ever-growing gray population for a country.</li>

School textbooks are prepared and edited by education experts who consider it necessary for children to learn both theories and practical skills. Language courses can improve their communication skills, including the ability to describe a subject or issue clearly. Maths can improve mathematical skills, such as budgeting, saving money, and comparing prices.

School rules can help students understand the behaviour that is not acceptable, such as cheating and bullying. Teachers also teach children good manners during the lesson, when children talk to classmates, interrupt others and express their views. Schools have textbooks containing fables teaching children moral lessons, so children can have a good understanding of the qualities of a respectful person, such as integrity, loyalty and honesty.</li>

Well-educated people can solve problems faster and complete work efficiently as they are familiar with all advanced practices and tools used in industry. They have better literacy skills so they can possess information and grasp new ideas quickly. A company with college-educated employees is more productive and competitive. As people with academic qualifications are knowledgeable, they are more capable of working out creative solutions whenever they spot problems. Innovations are also important to a country’s economic growth.</li>

<li>健康：<br>A接受教育 B 学会各种调整情绪的办法 C 更加健康<br>解释(A-B)：学校的一些课程，比如说体育课和艺术课程还有一些课外活动，可以发展孩子的爱好，让他们能够放松和正确疏导压力。<br>解释(A-B)：还有，一些有很强学术背景的人都很爱看书，这就意味着他们可以通过看书来开阔思路，遇到困难时也知道怎么解决。<br>解释(B-C)：当他们遇到困难时也会很乐观。<br>词伙：manage emotions 管理情绪<br>extracurricular activities 课外活动<br>cope with stress 疏导压力<br>academic background 学术背景<br>avid reader 读书迷<br>confront challenges 面对挑战<br>翻译：Education can make people healthy, happy individuals as they learn how to manage emotions. Schools have courses such as PE and art and extracurricular activities that help children develop hobbies, which allow them to feel relaxed and cope with stress in healthy ways. In addition, people who have a strong academic background are avid readers, meaning that they can broaden their minds by reading books and understand the options available for them when they confront challenges. They would be optimistic when handling challenges.</li>

<li>身体发展：父母的起居饮食对小孩的健康有影响，父母的经济条件决定了小孩的营养<br>词伙：ways of life,  financial situations,  nourishing food<br>翻译：Parents also decide what children do every day, so the ways of life developed during childhood last into adulthood.

<h2 id="现在的孩子是不是更加礼貌？："><a href="#现在的孩子是不是更加礼貌？：" class="headerlink" title="现在的孩子是不是更加礼貌？："></a>现在的孩子是不是更加礼貌？：</h2><ol>
<li>文化：是的。解释1：更多小孩获得教育，学校里会灌输行为的规范，告诉他们怎么行为更加好。解释2：父母受教育程度比较高，他们也很注意孩子行为的教育。解释3：政府有很多宣传，告诉年轻人什么是好的行为。<br>词伙：school rules, discipline children, obey rules, follow behavioural norms<br>翻译：Children are possibly more conscious of good manners nowadays. They have wider access to education, and schools may impart a code of conduct to them and teach them how to behave well. Meanwhile, the educational level of parents is possibly higher than before, meaning that children can be taught to communicate with others in polite ways at home. The government also has some campaigns to teach the public what is acceptable behaviour, such as showing respect to others in social life.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>文化：不是。解释：现在电视和游戏里有很多脏话，网络上也有很多人吐槽，小孩会觉得使用这些语言是很正常的。解释2：父母很忙，很少和小孩出去社交，小孩变得羞涩，不喜欢和人交流。解释3：教育的标准下降，校园暴力增加，小孩耳熟目染，不知道怎么和人礼貌<br>词伙：verbal abuse, ranting on the Internet, abusive langauge, socially competent, school bullying, physical abuse<br>翻译：It is argued that children today are rude and impolite. It is possibly attributed to the influence of TV programmes and games, which expose children to verbal abuse, and ranting on the Internet is so common that children think the use of abusive language is the norm. Parents are also responsible for this problem, as they spend less time socialising with others. Their children stay at home and are less sociable. They are not very socially competent. The drop in the standard of education is the third reason. School bullying has become widespread, and children who are exposed to physical or verbal abuse do not have a good idea how to be polite and respectful to others.</li>

<li>休闲：提供一种解脱。解释1：电视和游戏的内容非常有趣，非常刺激，很容易吸引注意力，短时间不需要去思考学习。解释2：并不需要用脑，相对来说比较轻松。<br>词伙：take one’s mind off, mental effort<br>翻译：Media can offer a type of escapism. TV programmes and games are normally interesting and stimulating. They can easily engage children’s attention and take their minds off studies for a while. Meanwhile, these activities do not require mental effort, so they are relatively relaxing.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>家庭和朋友：缺乏父母的陪伴和社会的生活。解释1：父母太忙，没拥有时间和小孩在一起玩，譬如说读书，玩体育。解释2：父母没时间陪伴，他们不放心小孩出去玩，或者和小伙伴在一起，因此更加愿意孩子留在家里。<br>词伙：a rich social life, lead a busy life, socialise with peers<br>翻译：Children  are addicted to playing games and watching TV because they lack the company of parents and do not have a rich social life. Adults lead a busy life so they have little time to spend with children, such as reading books and playing sport. Meanwhile, as they are not able to watch their children, they choose to keep their children at home, instead of socialising with/mixing with peers.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>自我提升：有成就感。解释：游戏有奖励，觉得自己通关成功，会很开心。对比：学习相对来说比较难，然后老师和父母的期望比较高，压力大。<br>词伙：indulge in playing games, a sense of achievement, progress to the next level<br>翻译：Children indulge in gaming because they can gain a sense of achievement. Games normally present rewards when they accomplish missions, beat other players and progress to the next level. They will be happy and thrilled. In contrast, studies are challenging and stressful, especially when children consider it difficult to live up to the expectations of parents.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>知识：学校关注考试，而不是小孩的业余爱好和全面发展。解释1：学校关注升学率，提高自己的竞争力，因此觉得课外活动是浪费时间的。 解释2：课外活动需要资源，包括场地和老师去支持，不会去帮助孩子提升这方面的能力。<br>词伙：exam factories, well-rounded education, extra-curricular activities<br>翻译：Children watch TV and play games because schools have become exam factories and do not pay attention to well-rounded education. Schools try to help every student pass college entrance exams in an effort/attempt to increase their competitiveness; therefore, they think extra-curricular activities are a waste of time. Meanwhile, these activities normally require resources and facilities, such as playgrounds and teachers who can teach different classes, so schools are unwilling to support these activities. Without any other way to spend free time/leisure time, children would have no choice but to watch TV or play games.</li>

<li>效率、科技。教学方法传统，学生不感兴趣。 背景：学生的注意力很难集中，完成一些重复的学习任务会觉得无聊。解释：学校可能担心各种科技影响学生学习，老师上课使用传统的教学方法，譬如说书本等，很难吸引学生注意。<br>词伙：short attention span, repetitive learning tasks, conventional methods, grab attention/generate interest<br>翻译：One reason why young people have a negative attitude towards education is that the teaching methods of teachers fail to engage students. Due to short attention span, children can feel bored if they are required to complete repetitive learning tasks. Schools do not pay attention to this problem, and they never consider the use of multimedia and electronic devices to present information in more engaging ways, because they see technology as a distraction rather than a powerful tool. Teachers are trained to teach every lesson in traditional ways, such as using textbooks, which cannot generate students’  interest in class activities.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>收入。学习的内容太过理论化。背景：学生发现所学的知识和毕业以后的工作需要相差很大，学生觉得无用，对找工作也没有用。解释：学校老师自身没有工作的经验，他们经常教授理论，概念，对找工作用处不大。他们会怀疑学习的价值，对学校教育产生厌学情绪。<br>词伙：course content, show little interest<br>翻译：Another reason why students are not interested in school work is that they think the knowledge is theoretical and even useless to their job in the future. Most teachers do not have experience working in industry, and they teach theories, formulas and concepts that are possibly not used widely in the workplace. Students spend hours doing homework and digesting course content, but they may find this kind of knowledge is of little value when they graduate. They will raise questions about the value of attending school and show little interest in schooling.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>个人发展。学校学习的内容也是学生厌学的理由之一。背景：学校学习以考试为主，课程也是为考试负责的。解释：老师只会教授考试技巧，而不是培养学生的兴趣爱好，丰富技能。学生觉得学的东西和他们没有关联，这让学生觉得学习没有乐趣。<br>词伙：exam-oriented, exam techniques, develop interests/ hobbies, diversify skills<br>翻译：Another reason is that the school curriculum does not help students develop talents and skills. Schools are all exam-oriented, and classes are all designed for teaching exam techniques. Teachers hardly pay attention to developing students’  interests/ hobbies and diversifying their skills. They lose the motivation to study hard if they realise that they are not gifted in what they learn.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>家庭，朋友。家长老师对学生忽视也是导致学生学习没有兴趣的原因之一。 解释：老师要教很多学生，没有精力照顾有学习问题的孩子，家长上班很忙也无法顾及到他们的孩子。学生学习差，没有兴趣学习。<br>词伙：learning difficulties, school work, stay well-motivated<br>翻译：Exposure to neglect is also considered as a cause for students’ negative attitude towards school education. Teachers do not have energy to care for all students in the classroom, especially those who experience learning difficulties, while parents are busy at work and do not have time to give children sufficient support in school work. As a result, students may not  stay well-motivated in education.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>朋友。 同学或者朋友的行为导致其他学生的厌学。解释：在学校可能受到欺凌，很害怕，不愿意去学校。解释2：身边小伙伴有些不好的行为，模仿，影响学习的成绩，对于学习没有信心，不感兴趣。<br>词伙：school bullying, copy wrong behaviour, taking drugs, school performance, low self-esteem<br>翻译：The negative peer pressure or behavioural problems of fellow students may be a reason why children have a negative attitude towards education. Some children are unwilling to go to school because they are the victim of school bullying. Meanwhile, some children tend to copy misbehaviour/wrong behaviour of their peers, such as playing games, taking drugs and smoking. This can have an impact on school performance/grades. They might lack confidence and have low self-esteem. That is also another reason why they are not willing to go to school to study.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="提高学生兴趣的方法："><a href="#提高学生兴趣的方法：" class="headerlink" title="提高学生兴趣的方法："></a>提高学生兴趣的方法：</h2><ol>
<li>(效率)使用高科技和现代教学方式，解释：内容比较有趣，有图像、声效，吸引学生的注意，让他们对课程更感兴趣。<br>词伙：teaching aids, make every class interesting and engaging, visual input, sound effects<br>翻译：One useful way to fuel students’ enthusiasm for studies is to use modern technology. Teachers can use some hi-tech teaching aids, such as projectors, which have stimulating content, including visual input and sound effects.  This might attract students’ attention and arouse their interest in courses.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>(知识)其中一个解决方法是因材施教 背景：学生不同的特点，需要不同的材料、教学方法等等。解释：学生更加容易理解和掌握学习内容，对学习更加有自信和兴趣学习。<br>词伙：tailor courses to the levels and needs of students, build confidence<br>翻译：Additionally, teaching can be individualised to provide students with relevant support, thus stimulating students’ interest in school education. Students have different characteristics, meaning that they need different teaching materials or methods. If teachers can tailor courses to match the needs of learners, students can grasp course content more easily. Thus students will  be motivated to study harder.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>(赚钱)另一个解决方法是让学生去实习。解释：让学生去实习和提高他们的动手能力，将理论和实践相结合，让他们感受到学习的实用性，更加感兴趣。<br>词伙：do work experience, apply theory to practice, practical implications<br>翻译：Another practical method to deal with the students’ aversion to education might provide them with internship opportunities. Schools can work with some companies to allow students to do work experience and apply theory to practice. Students can see the practical implications of what they learn at school and put more effort in studies.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>(自我提升) 关注学生的天赋。背景：每个人擅长的东西不同。解释：提供不同课程，不只是用必修课的成绩来衡量学生的优秀程度，认可学生不同科目上的天赋，这样才可以给学生自信，他们才觉得在学校可以找到自我。<br>词伙：natural ability, excel at, measure of excellence, build confidence, a sense of pride<br>翻译：Schools should also respect the talents of students. They may have the natural ability to excel at different skills or subjects. Schools should provide different courses, instead of using the performance of some core subjects as the only measure of excellence of students. THe education system should recognise their aptitude in respective areas of study, thereby helping them build confidence. This is how they can gain a sense of pride in schooling.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>(休闲娱乐)给孩子娱乐和玩耍的时间，学习不至于压力很大。 背景：小孩没有那么强的学习能力和精力去应付很多的作业。解释：控制作业量，让小孩觉得自己可以理解，跟得上别人，知道劳逸结合，也会更加容易保持热情。<br>词伙：reduce pressure<br>翻译：It is also important to give children time for play and leisure activities, so education will be less demanding. They do not have nergy or cognitive skills to handle tough workloads. It is therefore necessary to reduce the amount of homework to a degree where children can fully digest all information and catch up with peers. If they balance studies and leisure, they can maintain enthusiasm more easily.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>(自我提升) 给学生鼓励和奖励。背景：小孩对于自己未来的发展思维不清晰，他们很多时候需要别人的认可来知道自己的选择是对的。解释：老师可以通过表扬来认可学生的努力，奖品来认可他们的出色。结果：他们会更加努力。<br>词伙：recognise progress<br>翻译：Teachers can give students encouragement and rewards. Children do not have a clear idea what they intend to achieve in the future, and therefore, they need the positive reinforcement of others to gain confidence in their choices. Teachers can praise them to recognise their effort and present some rewards to acknowledge their success. They will continue to put their efforts in attaining other academic objectives.</li>

<li>A 明确的的方向和目标 B  集中注意力 C 成功<br>背景: 人的精力有限，而做完一个事业需要时间和精力<br>解释(B-C)：制定计划，每天知道做什么<br>词伙：a sense of purpose, clear objectives, require time and energy, work out plans, make to-do lists<br>翻译：The successful people always have a sense of purpose, as well as clear objectives. People’s energy is limited, while achieving success in one’s career requires time and energy. They have a clear idea of what they desire to do, so they will work out a plan and make to-do lists every single day. For example, people who intend to become renowned scientists may attend science courses at school and spend many hours doing experiments in the lab, until they make meaningful strides in the areas of studies they choose.</li>

They have exceptional intellectual skills, meaning that they can easily memorise knowledge and grasp abstract theories and concepts.

This means that they have resources to draw upon, whenever they meet challenges. When running a business, for example, they may borrow money and gain advice from friends they meet in business settings or networking events.

Without the support from the state, the artistic skills in making handicrafts, textile products and accessories would possibly die out in the future, as these trades have lost popularity among young people.

The government budget is limited, and the spending on art can use up the money which can otherwise be allocated to other industries and public services. In communities where people struggle with a basic standard of living, they would call on the state to prioritise the provision of public transport, healthcare and education. They would not support the funding for art, which is regarded as a luxury. The expenditure on education and medicla care can reduce disposable income, and lower consumer spending can undermine economic growth.</li>

History always repeats itself, and there are some timeless rules we can follow to handle similar problems. For example, when we borrow money from banks to buy luxuries, we need to bear in mind the risk of overspending-one habit linked to the financial crisis in 2018. Likewise, when we are anxious about the lasting impact of an economic slowdown, economists may suggest that in history, every economic downturn is followed by a recovery and a boom. In other words, history can give us guidance when making important decisions and allay our fear.</li>

Historians have different accounts of historic events, showing differences in value systems, political opinions and attitudes. People who read history books and watch documentaries will be curious about sometimes contrasting views about the same historical figure.

A country’s culture is intertwined with its history. The development of a country in early stages determines the evolution of some traditions, such as cuisine, the main livelihoods, ways of dressing and crafts. For example, seafood remains an intergral part of the diet of families in some countries such as Japan, in large part due to the fact that fishing used to a primary source of income for these nations.

The world is changing constantly, and the rules and empirical knowledge learned from historical events are possibly not applicable in today’s world.

Museums sometimes fail to attract visitors, as there are other more interesting attractions, such as amusement parks. In this case, museums cannot break even easily. Additionally, some people prefer to go to virtual museums, which are free and open 24 hours a day.

<li>经济：促进经济发展<br>解释：例如，化学肥料的应用和高产作物的发展，加快了粮食作物的生长，从而提高了产量。同时，化学物质可以用来延缓水果的成熟并延长新鲜农产品的保质期，因此农民生产的食物更有可能被送到食客手中，而不是腐坏或腐烂。最后，转基因食品的发明，如抗虫害和干旱的食品，可以增加丰收的机会。粮食生产和销售得越多，个人和企业会挣钱越多。<br>词伙：boost the economy,application of chemical fertilisers, the development of high-yield crops,speed up the growth of food plants, increase crop yields,delay ripening of fruit ,extend the shelf life,be delivered to , be resistant to pests and droughts, increase the chance of good harvests<br>翻译：Technological advances in farming and food production can boost the economy. The application of chemical fertilisers and the development of high-yield crops, for example, speed up the growth of food plants, thereby increasing yields. Meanwhile, chemicals can be used to delay ripening of fruit and extend the shelf life of fresh produce, so the food produced by farmers is more likely to be delivered to eaters, rather than being spoiled or rotten. Finally, the invention of GM food, such as those resistant to pests and droughts, can increase the chance of good harvests. If more food is produced and sold, individuals and businesses can certainly make more money.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>生活质量： 解决粮食短缺问题，增加选择性，提高生活水平<br>解释： 现代饲养方法，如在有限空间圈养动物，可以防止能量损失，保证所有农场产肉率增加。这种措施可以稳定食品供应量并解决世界性的饥荒。另外，新品种食物，如无籽瓜和人造肉等，增加了饮食的多样性。此外，食品运输和制冷服务及设施可以远距离、跨区域向消费者提供食品。这些在满足胃口的同时，也帮助我们建立了均衡的饮食。<br>词伙：address the food shortage,give people more choices, contemporary farming methods,keep animals in small enclosures, prevent energy loss, deal with food security issues,fight hunger worldwide, add more choices to our diet,food transportation,refrigeration services and facilities ,travel long distances to,satisfy our appetite for food,have a balanced diet<br>翻译：The increase in food production can also address the food shortage and give people more choices, thereby improving the standard of living. Contemporary farming methods, such as keeping animals in small enclosures to prevent energy loss, can ensure that more meat is produced by every farm. It can deal with food security issues and fight hunger worldwide. Additionally, the creation of some new food varieties, such as seedless melon and some man-made meat products, can add more choices to our diet. What’s more, the development in food transportation and refrigeration services and facilities allow food to travel long distances to consumers in different regions. It not only satisfies our appetite for food but also helps us to have a balanced diet.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>费用：先进农业技术，降低食物成本。<br>解释：转基因技术已成功培育出具有特殊性能的新品种，如抗病毒、抗虫、抗寒、耐盐、耐碱等。因此，食物可以在恶劣的条件下生产。更高的食物产量可以稳定甚至降低食品成本，降低大都数消费者的生活成本。<br>词伙：lead to lower food prices, transgenic technology, cultivate new species ,virus and pest-resistant, cold-resistant,salt and alkali-resistant,harsh conditions,cut food costs ,reduce the cost of living<br>翻译：The innovations in food technology can also lead to lower food prices. Transgenic technology has successfully cultivated new species which have special qualities, like virus and pest-resistant, cold-resistant,salt and alkali-resistant. It means that food can be produced in harsh conditions. Higher food yields can help stabilise or even cut food costs for most consumers, reducing the cost of living for them.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>环境：农业先进技术，减少对自然资源的使用<br>解释：一些创新的耕作做法可能有利于环境。这些做法减少了对土地等自然资源的使用。例如，室内农业和无土壤农业不使用可耕地，却可以供应食物。这意味着农民不需要清理土地和砍伐树木来耕作。同时，集约化耕作等方法也可以减少土地的使用。<br>词伙：innovative farming practices,be beneficial to the environment,reduce the use of natural resources,indoor farming and soil-free farming,arable land,clear land and cut down trees,intensive farming<br>翻译：Some innovative farming practices can be beneficial to the environment. These practices reduce the use of natural resources, such as land. For example, indoor farming and soil-free farming can provide food without using arable land. This means that farmers do not have to clear land and cut down trees for farming. Meanwhile, methods such as intensive farming can also reduces the use of land.</li>

<li>环境：破坏和污染环境。<br>解释：人造化肥和农药在农业中的大量使用会引起土地退化，这些有毒物质也会污染地下水源。食物生产中使用的机械和不同的交通工具会增加排放。集约农业会增加能源消耗，因为动物供暖会消耗更多电能。更让人心忧的是转基因植物的栽培会减少作物多样性，因为人们逐渐舍弃传统作物。这对生态系统的影响是不可估量的，因为基因库会从根本上发生改变。<br>词伙：cutting-edge agricultural technology，damage and pollute the environment,massive use of man-made fertilizers and pesticides，cause land degradation, pollute underground water sources ,machinery and different means of transportation,increase emissions，increase energy consumption,  keep animals warm,cultivation of GE crops, reduce diversity of crops, change the gene pool fundamentally<br>翻译：On the other hand, cutting-edge agricultural technology can damage and pollute the environment. The massive use of man-made fertilizers and pesticides in farming can cause land degradation, and toxins can pollute underground water sources. Machinery and different means of transportation used in food production can increase emissions. Intensive farming can increase energy consumption, as more electricity is used to keep animals warm. An even more worrying problem is the cultivation of GE crops, which can reduce diversity of crops, as people gradually abandon those conventional plants. The effect on the ecosystem is immeasurable as the gene pool can be changed fundamentally.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>健康：可能会对身体有害。<br>解释： 在植物和动物生产过程中使用的化肥和农药这些有毒物质或者抗生素等，会导致毒素残留在植物或动物体内，从而引起食用者食物中毒。而有些转基因生物产品也可能含有有毒物质和过敏源，会对人体健康产生不利影响，严重的甚至可以致癌或导致某些遗传疾病。<br>词伙：do harm to,chemical fertilizers and pesticides , toxic substances or antibiotics, poisoning of food users, genetically modified biological products,contain toxic substances and allergens, have adverse effects on human health, cause cancer or lead to certain genetic diseases<br>翻译：Another negative effect is the possible harm the modern technology may do to human beings.Chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in the production of plants and animals, such as toxic substances or antibiotics, will cause toxins to remain in plants or animals, which will lead to poisoning of food users. Some genetically modified biological products may also contain toxic substances and allergens, which may have adverse effects on human health, and may even cause cancer or lead to certain genetic diseases.</li>

<li>经济：A 机械化 B 提高效率，产品质量，降低成本, 减少雇佣 C 企业利润上升<br>解释(A-B)：机器可以比人类工人更准确、更有效地执行重复的任务，这意味着自动化工厂可以比依赖人类劳动的工厂更快地完成订单，创造更多的收入。<br>解释(A-B)：机器24小时运转，不像人一样感到疲劳和负面情绪，所以机器制造的产品通常比手工制造的质量更高。<br>解释(A-B)：机械化允许公司雇佣更少的人，从而降低劳动力成本，增加公司利润。<br>词伙：maximise the profit, the running cost, repetitive tasks, automated factory, fill orders, human labour, machine-made products, made by hand, labour cost, increase corporate profits<br>翻译：Mechanization can maximise the profit of companies by enhancing production efficiency, improving product quality and cutting the running cost. Machines can perform repetitive tasks more accurately and efficiently than human workers, meaning that an automated factory can fill orders faster and create more revenue than a plant relying on human labour. Meanwhile, machines operate 24/7 without experiencing fatigue and negative emotions like human beings, so machine-made products are normally of higher quality than those made by hand. Finally, mechanisation allows firms to employ fewer people, thus reducing the labour cost and increasing corporate profits.</li>

Machines can operate 24 hours a day as they are controlled by programmes. These machines can free people from stressful work, so workers can have more leisure time and experience a sense of well-being. As people have more leisure time to relax and cope with fatigue, work-related accidents will decline and the spending on the medical system will be reduced.</li>

<li>科技：A机械化B 人们不用作那么多重复性工作 C 科技创新<br>解释<br>A机械化B 人们不用做那么多重复性工作 C 科技创新<br>(A-B): 由于机器处理手工工作，人们可以花宝贵的时间读书，获取知识，进行实验，检查工作程序和测试他们的创造性想法。这些都为科技创新铺平了道路。<br>(A-B): 企业可以使用他们曾经用来雇佣员工的资金进行研发。这些公司将有更多的发明。<br>词伙：technological innovation, manual work, carry out experiments, creative ideas, research and development<br>翻译：Mechanization can free people from doing repetitive work, which can help to contribute to their technological innovation. As machines take care of manual work, people can spend their valuable time reading books, gaining knowledge, carrying out experiments, examining work procedures and testing their creative ideas. All these tasks pave the way for scientific and technological innovations. Additionally, enterprises can use the money that they once used to hire workers for research and development. These companies will have more inventions.</li>

Machines hardly make mistakes and an automated factory only needs several workers to manage; therefore, companies can cut jobs. Public consumption decreases and companies create less revenue, thereby damaging/hurting the economy. It can hurt the standard of living of those people who are unable to retrain for new employment.</li>

<li>法律：A 机械化 B 很多人失业C 治安不是很好<br>解释<br>A 机械化 B 很多人失业C 治安不是很好<br>(A-B)在机械化时代，大量的机器可以代替人工操作，因为它们的产量更高，性能更好。工厂工人可能会失去工作，如果他们没有受过良好的教育，他们就无法再培训去接受市场上的其他职位。<br>(B-C)如果失业率大涨，很可能会引起民众强烈不满,甚至会导致他们有反社会的行为，这会引起社会的动荡和不安。<br>词伙：have a negative impact on/ manual operation/factory workers/ lose jobs/job requirements/ repetitive work/ jobless rate/ unemployment rate/ anti - social behaviour/ social unrest<br>翻译：Mechanization may be a threat to public order since it may make many people unemployed. In the era of mechanization, a large number of machines can replace the manual operation, due to their higher output and better performance. Factory workers may lose their jobs, and if they are not well-educated, they are not able to retrain for other positions in the job market. A higher unemployment rate may even result in an increase in anti - social behaviour and cause social unrest as jobless people are unhappy with the standard of living.</li>

<li>社会文化：A 机械化B 很多传统手工艺会消失 C 影响产品多样性<br>解释(A-B)：与大量生产的产品相比，许多传统手工艺品可能要花费更长的时间和更多的成本来生产，所以生产成本可能更高，利润可能更小。<br>解释(A-B)：对于消费者来说，他们可能更喜欢购买机器制造的产品，这些产品通常可以以较低的成本获得。由于工匠和技术人员无法谋生，他们将放弃生计，手工制作产品的技能将消失。市场上的定制产品将会减少。<br>词伙：hand-made products, mass-produced products, production cost, earn a living, give up livelihoods, make products by hand, custom-made products<br>翻译：Mechanisation will threaten traditional hand-made products as well as the skills involved in making these products. Compared with mass-produced products, many traditional handicrafts may take a longer time and cost more for production, so the production cost may be higher and the profit may be smaller. As for consumers, they may prefer to buy the products made by machines, which are normally available at a lower cost. As craftsmen and technicians fail to earn a living, they will give up their livelihoods and the skills of making products by hand will die out. There will be less custom-made products available in the market.</li>

A profit-driven company may manipulate consumers to maximise its revenue, and some of its practices are unethical. Some companies, for example, fail to look after personal information of their customers with due care, and some of them even profit from selling such data. Additionally, some companies make no attempt to fulfil their duties to safety of employees and to the environmental protection of communities.

Technology has led to changes in what people do for pleasure, and they can enjoy different leisure activities in isolation. For example, they can play computer games, chat with friends by using mobile phones and watch films online. All these activities substitute for those conventional choices, such as going to the cinema with friends and playing sport together, which involve interactions with others.</li>

<li>科技<br>A.各种科技让人们可以独立工作，B.完成事情 C.对关系网的依赖减少<br>背景：科技让人们独立工作，没有人脉也可以执行任务<br>解释(A-B)：当工作中需要解决问题，他们能在网上找到问题的答案。<br>解释(A-B)：计算机程序，移动电话应用程序和工具，使他们自己能够处理问题。<br>解释(B-C)他们不重视参加社交活动来建立人脉<br>词伙：meet new friends 见新朋友<br>enable people to work independently使人们独立工作<br>perform tasks without using social networks 不用社交网络执行任务<br>come across problems 遇到问题<br>computer programmes计算机程序<br>mobile phone apps and tools移动电话应用程序和工具<br>attach importance to 重视<br>attend networking events 参加社交活动<br>翻译：Another reason is that people do not consider it important to meet new friends. Technology enables people to work independently, and perform tasks without using social networks. Whenever they come across problems at work, they find answers online. There are also computer programmes, mobile phone apps and tools which empower them to deal with everything themselves. They do not attach importance to building a network of contacts by attending networking events, so they tend to be less socially active.</li>

People have to work hard to survive the cut-throat competition. It is not unusual for managers, engineers and office clerks to work overtime every day to handle their workloads and meet the deadline. The time for socialisation thus dwindles, as they return home tired.</li>
</ol>

Cities are overcrowded, and open spaces available for social activities are limited. In the past, people could go jogging in parks, visit street markets and watch outdoor musical shows in city squares, but now these community activities have disappeared as space is used for housing development. City dwellers do not have opportunities to talk to other members of community.</li>

It can help people make more friends, and a network of contacts makes it easier for people to gain more opportunities for career progression, such as better job opportunities and a good chance of running a successful business. For example, attending a fund-raising event may help people meet government officials and successful business people, who have resources and power to benefit one’s career.</li>

</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>个人发展<br>A 团队工作  B 有压力提升自己的能力 C 对个人发展很好<br>解释(A-B)：团队中有很多优秀的人，团队的其他成员可以受到鼓舞，学习他们的工作方式和培养同样的工作素质。<br>对比：如果没有好的示范，人们感受不到提升自己技能的需要<br>词伙：upgrade skills    提升技能<br>professional development    职业发展<br>well-disciplined    良好的自制力<br>behave in the same manner    以同样的方式行事<br>develop the same qualities    培养同样的品质<br>role models    榜样<br>翻译：Working in a strong group can also push people to upgrade skills for professional development. The team may have some excellent members who are well-disciplined, ambitious and highly productive, so the rest of the team can be inspired to behave in the same manner and develop the same qualities. People who work alone without role models may not feel the need to improve their own skills.</li>

Besides, in one team, some team members are not capable of contributing to the team, or they do not have organisational skills to perform their duties. The poor performance of some people can definitely make the whole team less productive.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>个人发展<br>A 团队工作  B  依赖他人  C 不思进取，工作能力没有提高<br>背景：团队中的一些成员可能愿意承担更大的责任和承担更多的任务。(原因：他们希望团队成功，或者是因为他们受到内部奖励(如个人发展)的驱动。)<br>解释(B-C)：其他一些人倾向于利用勤奋的队友，因此他们失去了专注于工作的动力。<br>词伙：achieve their objectives    获得目标<br>take greater responsibility and assume more tasks    承担更多责任，完成更多任务<br>internal rewards    内在奖励<br>personal developments     个人发展<br>take advantage of    利用<br>lose the motivation   失去动力<br>be dedicated to work   投入于工作<br>翻译：Another danger of working in a team is that people tend to rely on others, instead of working hard to achieve their objectives.

<li>生活质量：收入好，解决基本的需求，提升生活质量。<br>解释：生活成本与日俱增，商品越来越消费不起。而高收入，不仅能支付生活基本开支，如水电账单、房贷、孩子学费等，还能用来购买保险和储备养老；而且，收入高，人们还可以度假、买奢侈品或花钱买高科技设备，生活质量得以提升。<br>词伙：give priority to sth.,search for a job, cover basic needs,improve the quality of life, high living costs,afford expenses,house mortgage, buy insurance,prepare for retirement,thanks to, high-paying jobs, take a vacation, afford luxuries, hi-tech gadgets<br>翻译：People give priority to income when searching for a job as income can cover basic needs and improve the quality of life. Living costs are higher than ever and goods are less affordable. With the high income,it is easy for people to afford expenses, such as water and electricity bills, house mortgage, children’s tuition and so on, and the rest can be used to buy insurance and prepare for retirement.Additionally, thanks to the high-paying jobs,people can take a vacation, afford luxuries and spend money on hi-tech gadgets, which can improve the standard of living.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>成就感：提高收入可以给员工成功感<br>解释：大家一般都觉得一个人的收入反映了他或她对雇主赚钱的价值。如果员工得到更高的薪水，他们会感到自己受到重视，并明白他们的才华、努力和贡献得到了公司的认可。他们会觉得自己的事业进步了，获得了幸福感。<br>词伙：pay rise, increase job satisfaction, create a sense of fulfilment,value to, feel valued be recognised by,advance one’s career,gain a sense of happiness<br>翻译：A pay rise can increase job satisfaction by creating a sense of fulfilment. It is logic to think that one’s income reveals his or her value to the profit-making of the employer. If staff are offered a higher salary, they will feel valued and understand that their talent, effort and contribution are recognised by the company. They will feel that they have advanced their career and gained a sense of happiness.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>生活质量： 工作稳定，保障好，有安全感。<br>解释：商业环境日新月异，因此很多人关注工作保障。有人愿意长期在大公司工作，因为这些公司通常会提供额外福利，如带薪假期、医疗保险，甚至住房福利。雇主也会加入社会养老计划，因此，雇员离开职场后可以享受舒适的退休生活。<br>词伙：a sense of security, provide job-related benefits, business environment,be of concern to sb.,in the workplace, be interested in, work for big companies permanently, provide fringe benefits,paid holidays, medical insurance,housing allowances, pension scheme of the country,enjoy a comfortable retirement<br>翻译：A good job is also expected to give people a sense of security by providing job-related benefits. The business environment is constantly changing, and job security is of concern to many people in the workplace. Some of them are interested in working for big corporations permanently, and these companies normally provide fringe benefits such as paid holidays, medical insurance and even housing allowances. Employers also participate in the pension scheme of the country, so employees can enjoy a comfortable retirement at the end of their working lives.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>社会关系： 健康和平等的合作关系是好工作的重要指标，因为人们在合作中可以找到归属感。<br>解释：人有时会自信心不足，如果能一直从同事或上级那得到支持和建议，他们会表现上乘。当他们表达对公司政策或工作做法的想法时，无需担心被报复或惩罚。因此他们对公司发展和个人职业发展都抱有信心，就会对工作很满意。<br>词伙：healthy and supportive relationships, the key to a satisfying job,a sense of belonging to a strong group,lack confidence in sth.,gain support and advice from sb., perform duties well,express ideas about sth.,work practices, worry about retaliation or punishment, have a positive attitude towards,be satisfied with the job<br>翻译：Healthy and supportive relationships with colleagues and supervisors are also the key to a satisfying job as people find a sense of belonging to a strong group. People sometimes lack confidence in their ability to complete their work. If they gain support and advice constantly from coworkers or superiors, they will be able to perform their duties well. When they express their ideas about company policy or work practices, they do not need to worry about retaliation or punishment. They will have a positive attitude towards the future development of the company as well as have optimism about their career advancement, they will be satisfied with the job.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>知识：职业培训，更能应付工作挑战，对工作满意。<br>解释：职业培训是决定员工对工作看法的另一因素。现代社会竞争激烈，无数求职者进入职场时，不具备足够技巧和知识来处理高难度工作。因而，他们对能提高技能和拓宽知识面很感兴趣。有员工培训体制的公司能吸引渴求事业成功的人。他们有进步的感觉，即使竞争白炽化也会保持积极的心态。<br>词伙：job training,perception of,be highly competitive,enter the workforce, sufficient skills and knowledge,sharpen skills, expand the knowledge base, get prepared for challenges,staff training system, attract people, intend to do sth.,a sense of progress,fierce competition,stay positive<br>翻译：Job training is another factor that determines employees’ perception of a job. The modern world is highly competitive, and countless job-seekers enter the workforce without sufficient skills and knowledge to handle demanding jobs. They are interested in the opportunities to sharpen skills and expand the knowledge base to get prepared for challenges in their careers. If companies have staff training systems, they can attract people who intend to have a successful career. They have a sense of progress and stay positive even when competition is fierce.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>家庭：家庭友好政策，工作家庭平衡，员工满意。<br>解释：大部分员工有孩子，如果为了工作牺牲家庭生活，他们会愧疚和不开心。他们希望参与孩子的抚养，而不是缺席某些重要事件，如家庭成员的生日会等。如果公司能考虑到这些需求，并能给员工扮演不同角色提供灵活性，那么员工会很忠诚。<br>词伙：family-friendly policies, the key to sth.,job satisfaction,strike a balance between work and life,keep a good mood,feel guilty and unhappy,sacrifice sth. for, be involved in sth.,upbringing of children, be absent from,birthday parities,consider this need, offer flexibility, juggle different roles, inspire loyalty<br>翻译：Family-friendly policies are also the key to job satisfaction as employees can strike a balance between work and life and always keep a good mood. A considerable number of employees have children and they feel guilty and unhappy if they have to sacrifice their family life for their jobs. They want to be involved in the upbringing of children, rather than absent from some major events, such as birthday parties of their family. If companies consider this need and offer workers more flexibility in juggling different roles, it can inspire loyalty.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>个人价值： 完成梦想，实现个人价值。<br>解释：大部分年轻人在不需要担心基本生活需求的环境里长大，他们越来越关注是否能通过达成个人目标和完成梦想而过上有价值的生活。如果公司为他们提供职位、资金或项目以发挥潜力，他们将受到激励，并有动力努力工作。这让他们在工作中有一种深深的满足感。<br>词伙：be popular with sb.,allow sb. to do sth.,achieve ambitions,show talents, a large proportion of people,worry about the access to food, survival needs, be increasingly concerned about,lead rewarding lives,achieve personal targets, reach potential, be stimulated/motivated to do, a sense of contentment<br>翻译：A job can be popular with people if it allows them to achieve ambitions and show their talents. A large proportion of young people grow up in a world where they do not worry about the access to food, or other survival needs. They are increasingly concerned about whether they can lead rewarding lives by achieving their personal targets and making their dreams come true. If companies offer them positions, capital or projects to reach potential, they will be stimulated and motivated to work hard. This can give them a deep sense of contentment in their jobs.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>自我提升：工作要对社会有意义。解释：如果选择一家公司从事有意义的事业，他们很自豪，而不是关注该职位的经济回报。他们愿意看到自己的努力和努力对弱势群体的生活质量产生积极的影响，对社会产生影响。当他们为使世界变得更好而做的事情受到赞扬时，无论他们的收入如何，他们都能获得成就感。<br>词伙：<br>翻译：People also consider whether their jobs can contribute to society. They take pride in choosing a company to do something for worthy courses, rather than pay attention to financial rewards of the position. They are willing to see their hard work and effort make a positive difference to the quality of life of disadvantaged people and to the community. They can gain a sense of accomplishment when they receive compliments on something they do to change the world for better, regardless of income.</li>

This is a source of stress because they do not have a positive outlook on life.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="如何减少压力？："><a href="#如何减少压力？：" class="headerlink" title="如何减少压力？："></a>如何减少压力？：</h2><ol>
<li>效率：加强自我管理，提高工作效率。<br>解释：压力来自于无法有效地处理工作负荷：当人们不能有效地完成工作时，他们就会觉得紧张、焦虑、沮丧和害怕。因此，人们应该掌握一些基本技能，如管理时间，制定待办事项清单，在日历上标明主要的约会和最后期限。这样，他们就能够按时完成所有任务，而不是等到最后一刻才完成工作。<br>词伙：Self-management,arise from, the inability to do, handle workloads,complete work efficiently,feel anxious,feel stressed, feel frustrated, feel scared, acquire basic skills,make a to-do list,mark major appointments on ,leave work undone<br>翻译：Better self-management is definitely the key to stress management. Stress arises from the inability to handle workloads effectively: when people are not able to complete work efficiently, they will feel anxious, stressed, frustrated and scared. For this reason, people should acquire some basic skills, such as managing time, making a to-do list, marking major appointments and deadlines on the calendar, so they are capable of completing all tasks on time rather than leave work undone until the last minute.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>健康：身体健康，可以轻松应付压力。<br>解释：健康的人通常都能对慢性压力未雨绸缪。原因一，身体条件好的人一般把事情安排得井然有序，例如：早起和分配时间在家做饭。这意味着他们也规划自己的工作，在最后期限之前可以完成任务。另一个原因是：健康给人以应付压力所必需的能量、耐力和信心。很健康的人可以冷静应对压力，也鲜少会出现精神崩溃。<br>词伙：be well prepared to do sth.,handle chronic stress, enjoy satisfying physical condition, keep everything in order, get up early,allocate time to sth., plan one’s work, meet deadlines, energy, stamina and confidence,cope with stress, a high level of fitness, react to stress calmly, suffer from nervous breakdown<br>翻译：Healthy people are normally well prepared to handle chronic stress. The first reason is that people who enjoy satisfying physical condition keep everything in order, for example, getting up early and allocating time to home-cooking. This means that they also plan their work as well and have no problem in meeting deadlines. Another reason is that health gives energy, stamina and confidence which are required for coping with stress. With a high level of fitness, people react to stress calmly and hardly suffer from any nervous breakdown.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>知识：专业知识，冷静处理压力。<br>解释：当人们觉得自己不太可能解决一些问题时，压力会对他们产生毁灭性的影响。唯一预防方法是：增加知识和提高技能。受过良好教育的人，如果在解决棘手问题方面有丰富的经验，就会在面临压力的情况下保持冷静。他们知道用什么方法去解决问题。<br>词伙：have a devastating effect on, be unlikely to do, deal with some problems, prevent sth. from doing,increase knowledge and upgrade skills,well-educated people, have considerable experience, solve thorny problems,how to approach a problem<br>翻译：Expertise also holds the key to stress management.

</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>心理健康和心态：调整期望值，制定合理的目标。</li>
</ol>
<p>解释：高期望值有时迫使人们追求一些不切实际或无法实现的目标。如果不能达到目标，他们会产生一些消极情绪，沉溺于自我怀疑，这会雪上加霜。如此一来，即便是简单的任务看起来也很有挑战性和很大的压力。所以，人们应该降低期望，设定更多可实现的目标。他们可以轻松地达成期望。<br>词伙：adjust expectations, an integral part of dealing with stress,high expectations pressure sb. to do, fail to attain their objectives, experience some negative emotions ,indulge in self-doubt, add the stress level,avoid this situation,lower one’s expectations,set more achievable targets,match sth. at ease<br>翻译：Adjusting expectations is also an integral part of dealing with stress. High expectations sometimes pressure people to pursue some unrealistic or unattainable goals. If they fail to attain their objectives, they will experience some negative emotions and indulge in self-doubt, which can add the stress level.

They can match such expectations at ease.</p>

Animals are captured and kept in the cages but in their traditional home areas, they can roam freely and maintain their natural behavioural traits, such as interacting with other members of the same species. Animals lose freedom to hunt for food and they are either overfed or starving. Additionally, some zoos train animals for the purpose of entertaining tourists. Animals are beaten or whipped if failing to behave as instructed by trainers. Animal welfare campaigners argue that we have no right to use animals for entertainment and profit.</li>

Rare animals or endangered wildlife can receive care and treatment in zoos, where they can reproduce without facing threats from predators or hunters. Zoos function as conservation centres where scientists study animals and their behaviours to identify the best way to protect threatened species from extinction.  Another advantage of keeping animals in the zoos is that it can help people raise the awareness of animal conservation. Zoo trips are rewarding and educational, as visitors can gain knowledge about the living styles of animals and the factors putting these species at risk.  The contact with animals, including feeding animals, is an unforgettable experience for children, generating the interest in keep these lovely creatures alive.</li>

Meat is a primary source of protein, calorie and some nutrients essential to our health, such as calcium. Human beings have evolved to adapt to meat consumption. Eating meat can ensure the health of muscles and bones. Without meat as part of our diet, we may suffer from malnutrition. Children may not grow healthily without meet as part of their meals.

Meat was difficult to come by in the past, so people cooked meat on special festivals to show the extent to which they attached importance to these festivals, especially those which have religious implications. They also prepared meat dishes to serve important guests .

Eating meat can cause obesity and increase the intake of cholesterol- a trigger for heart diseases. The strong demand for meat can also drive the need for meat production and livestock farming, but poultry is sometimes the medium for spreading viruses such as bird flu.

<li>法律在保护环境方面可以发挥重要作用。<br>背景：在个人利益的驱使下，个人和公司有时会从事破坏环境的活动。<br>举例：开垦土地用于农业或住房开发。<br>解释：制止这种行为的最好办法是颁布法律，例如惩罚破坏森林的公民或公司。严厉的惩罚起到威慑作用。<br>词伙：preserve the environment, driven by self-interest, clear land, curb behaviour<br>翻译：Laws can play an important part in preserving the environment. Driven by self-interest, Individuals and companies are sometimes involved in environment-damaging activities, such as clearing land for farming or housing development. The best way to curb this kind of behaviour is to enact laws, such as punishing citizens or companies who are caught damaging forest. Harsh penalties serve as a deterrent.</li>

<li>背景：许多人没有意识到他们的习惯对环境的影响<br>举例：个人可以选择环保的生活方式来减少燃料的使用和造成环境污染的废物。<br>举例：人们可以步行或骑车上学或上班，使用公共交通工具而不是私家车来减少碳排放。<br>举例：他们还可以重复使用购物袋和回收易拉罐和瓶子，以减少垃圾。<br>对比：如果人们不觉得有必要改变他们的生活方式，严格的法律和推广绿色技术不会有很大的不同。<br>词伙：public transport/ private cars/ carbon carbon emissions/ shopping bags<br>翻译：The environmental problems can also be mitigated by changing citizens’ attitudes and lifestyles. It is necessary to keep the public well-informed about eco-friendly lifestyle choices, when many of them are not aware of the environmental consequences of their habits. Individuals can select eco-friendly ways of life to reduce the use of fuels and the waste which causes environmental pollution. People can walk or cycle to school or work, use public transport instead of private cars to reduce carbon carbon emissions. They can also reuse shopping bags and recycle cans and bottles to reduce waste. If people do not feel obliged to change their lifestyles, strict laws and the promotion of green technology would not make a huge difference.</li>

<li>技术： 可以被看作是解决现代生活造成的环境问题的一种方法。<br>背景：我们的日常生活对环境产生了影响，无论我们是否努力减少能源的使用，在现代世界做到碳中和基本上是不可能的。<br>举例：使用电气设备需要消耗电力，而电力通常是由燃烧矿物燃料产生的。<br>解释：使用清洁能源，如风能和太阳能，可以支持我们的日常生活，而不会产生温室气体排放。这些技术进步可以平衡现代生活的需要和可持续性发展的目标。<br>词伙：clean energy/wind power/solar power/ renewable resources<br>翻译：Technology can be seen as a solution to environmental problems caused by modern life. Our daily life has an impact on the environment, whether or not we try to cut down on energy use, and it is basically impossible to be carbon-neutral in the modern world. For example, the use of electrical equipment involves consumption of electricity, which is normally generated by burning fossil fuels. Therefore, only green technology can deal with this problem. The use of clean energy sources such as wind power and solar power can support our daily lives without creating greenhouse gas emissions. These technological advances can balance the needs of modern life and the objective of sustainability.</li>

One problem of the Internet is that people can post opinions and views freely and sometimes, their ideas are not supported by evidence. This is why the Internet is not accepted as a credible source of information in academic communities.

<li>生活标准<br>A 广告夸大产品的功能 B 解决人的一些需求  C 卖产品:<br>背景：广告上采取的一个常用的手段就是夸大产品的功能，以及暗示产品符合顾客的喜好。<br>解释(A-B)：他们对人们对金钱和健康的基本需求进行调查。<br>举例：比如一些公司卖产品着重其教育意义，一些人就会购买这些产品，因为害怕他们落后于人。<br>举例2：还有一些公司专注健康问题，比如为口腔问题设计的牙刷，运动设计的健身设备，还有提升空气质量的机器，杀菌的香皂。所有这些产品都没有广告推广的用处大，但是在有健康担忧的人们那里非常受欢迎。<br>词伙：sell products  卖产品<br>satisfy some needs of consumers 满足顾客的需求<br>give an exaggerated account of functions 夸大产品的功能描述<br>emphasise the educational benefits 强调教育好处<br>improve air quality 提升空气质量<br>health concerns 健康担忧<br>翻译：One common strategy adopted by advertisers to sell products is to give an exaggerated account of functions and suggest that these products can satisfy some needs of consumers. Advertising firms conduct research on the basic needs of people for money and health. Some companies, for example, promote their products by emphasising the educational benefits, and people buy these products, fearing that they may lag behind others if they are not knowledgeable enough. Similarly, there are a broad range of products designed for dealing with health issues, such as toothpaste for oral health, fitness equipment for work-outs, machines for improving air quality indoor, and soap for killing germs. All these products may not be as powerful as promoted by advertising, but they are popular with people who have health concerns.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>社会关系<br>A 广告说这是时尚的东西  B 大家希望自己合群 C 购买<br>背景：人类是社会动物，他们融入社群会感到有安全感。<br>解释(A-B)：一些广告商利用技巧宣传自己的产品非常时髦，或者发起针对目标顾客特点的营销活动。<br>如果人们看到这个广告符合他们的特征，他们可能就会买广告商品。<br>解释(B-C)：他们觉得他们需要遵守组群的规则。否则他们和同组的人没有共同话题。<br>举例：一个高科技产品广告说他们的产品被大多数家庭主妇使用，女人很难抗拒诱惑不去买它。<br>词伙：a sense of security 安全感<br>fit into a group 融入组群<br>hi-tech gadget 高科技产品<br>resist the temptation 抵抗诱惑<br>翻译：Advertising also influences consumers by tapping into their need to belong. Humans are social animals, and derive a sense of security from  fitting into a group，they think they belong to.   Advertisers sometimes use statistics to show how popular a product is among some people, or launch campaigns featuring people who have the same characteristics as intended consumers. If viewers identify with the characters in TV commercials, they would possibly buy advertised products. They believe that it is a group norm, and something that they need to conform to. Otherwise, they do not have talking points with other members of the same group. For example, if advertising suggests that a hi-tech gadget is used by a majority of housewives, it is difficult for a woman to resist the temptation to buy it.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>自我提升<br>A 广告使用明星代言 B 大家觉得自己可以提升 C 购买<br>背景：羡慕名人的人们可能会买和他们同样的产品，因为那些知名人士非常有魅力，身材很好也很聪明<br>举例：一些年轻顾客买体育明星代言的功能饮料，因为他们强烈认为喝这些饮料会提升他们在比赛和竞争中的体能和表现。<br>举例2：女生会买名人推广的:电视化妆品，配饰和衣服，她们认为穿戴这些产品可以让她们好看。<br>词伙：high-profile figures 高调的人<br>enhance their own physical strength and performance in…提高他们的体能和表现<br>energy drinks 功能饮料<br>improve appearance 变得好看<br>翻译：Another way to sway consumers to buy something is celebrity endorsement. People who admire celebrities may think  purchasing the same products as those high-profile figures can become glamorous, physically fit and intelligent. Some young consumers, for instance, purchase energy drinks advocated by sports stars, as they strongly believe that these drinks can enhance their own physical strength and performance in games and competitions. Girls, by contrast, purchase cosmetics, accessories and outfits promoted by supermodels and TV personalities, believing that wearing all these products can improve appearance.</li>

<ol start="4">
<li>行为<br>A 广告利用大家的攀比心理 B 将某些产品打造成地位象征 C 购买<br>背景：人们将产品和自信连在一起，尤其在收入差距不断增大的国家里。<br>解释(A-B)：如果他们能买奢侈品，他们感觉有一种满足感和骄傲。为了满足这些顾客的心理需求，广告产业会制造一些名牌，以高端市场为目标。<br>解释(B-C):如果人们觉得这些牌子是地位的标志，他们就会大量花费在这些产品上面。<br>词伙：promotstatus symbols 社会地位<br>self-esteem 自尊心<br>feel a sense of satisfaction and pride 有满足感和自豪感<br>afford some luxury brands 购买一些奢侈品<br>cater for the psychological needs 满足心理需求<br>create premium brands 创造优质产品<br>翻译：Advertising also taps into social comparison of people and build some brands as status symbols. People associate the possession of some products with self-esteem, especially in economies where the income gap is widening. They feel a sense of satisfaction and pride, if they can afford some luxury brands. To cater for the psychological needs of these consumers, the advertising industry has sought to create a number of premium brands which target the high end market. If people perceive these brands as a marker of status, they will spend lavishly on these items.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>知识<br>A  广告提供大量的信息  B 让好的产品更加出众 C 购买<br>背景：广告通过提供给产品的信息(特征，产品和服务的优势)，缩小买家和供货商的距离。<br>解释(A-B):顾客可以根据广告上提供的提示做出明确的决定。一些产品比竞争者的产品在质量、持久性还有其他一些标准表现更好。<br>解释(B-C)：这就会有个良性循环：有好的产品的商家盈利能力强，能维持市场花费的支出。<br>因为市场维持了一个品牌的意识，顾客就会继续购买，为这些产品的提升提供钱。<br>词伙：shape consumer behaviour 形成用户行为<br>reliable, well-known brands 依赖的，知名品牌<br>make well-informed decisions 做出明确的决定<br>branded products 知名品牌产品<br>virtuous cycle 良性循环<br>brand awareness 品牌知名度<br>翻译：Advertising can also shape consumer behaviour by helping them choose reliable, well-known brands. Advertising bridges the gap between buyers and suppliers by providing information about the functions, features and advantages of some products and services. Consumers can make well-informed decisions with the tips provided by advertisers, and some branded products which outperform rivals in quality, durability and other standards will stand out over time. This can form a virtuous cycle: the manufacturer of a better product is normally more profitable and capable of sustaining the expenditure on marketing. As marketing maintains the awareness of a brand, consumers will continue to buy it and provide money required for the upgrading of this product.</li>

<li>政治：A 新闻媒体是由政府或一些国家的政党控制的 B 会扭曲事实 C 新闻不可靠<br>解释(A-B)：当局有时审查揭露政治丑闻或批评政府政策的新闻文章。<br>解释(A-B)：有权势的政客可以通过撤回资金来影响新闻机构，因此新闻机构面临着压力，要求它们对这些政治人物进行正面报道。<br>解释(A-B)： 在某些情况下，政府甚至可以关闭一些报纸或电视台，因为他们不遵守命令或不以政府所要求的方式去操纵观众。<br>结果：新闻是有偏见的，公众不能从媒体得到真相。<br>词伙：news media, political parties, news articles, political scandals, news outlets, political figures, manipulate the audience<br>翻译：Sometimes news is unreliable since news media is controlled by the government or by political parties in some countries.  The authorities sometimes censor news articles which expose political scandals or criticise government policy.  Powerful politicians can influence news organisations by increasing or withdrawing funding, so news outlets are under pressure to portray these political figures in a positive light. In some cases, the government can even shut down some newspapers or TV stations for not complying with orders or reporting news to manipulate the audience in the ways demanded by the government.  As a result, the news is biased and  the public cannot get the truth from the media.</li>

<li>经济：A 私人公司来经营媒体        B 这些公司的终极目标是利益最大化<br>C 新闻报导失实<br>背景： 公司为了盈利，非常在意市场的需求<br>解释(B-C)：不惜制作假新闻，散步谣言，甚至是夸大事实以吸引更多的读者和观众以追求更高的收视率和销量。<br>这样，他们所提供的新闻报道不再客观。<br>词伙：economic profit, news agencies, market demands, fake news, spread rumours, give an exaggerated account, high ratings<br>翻译：Another reason why news is sometimes not credible is that in some countries news media relies on the sponsorship of private companies, whose ultimate target is to seek maximum economic profit. These news agencies are obedient to market demands, and more often than not, the news they select may create fake news, spread rumours or even giving an exaggerated account of a news event, to draw the attention of the readers and audiences and entertain them, in pursuit of high audience ratings and sales. As a result, the news reports provided by these news media companies are no longer reliable.</li>

<li>科技：A 网络媒体成为主流媒体之一     B 网络媒体没有得到很好的监管<br>C 新闻信息失实<br>背景：每个人都可以在网络媒体上传播信息，可能会扭曲事实的真相。网络监管者没有资源去检查每天网络上产生的数以千万计的新的帖子。<br>背景：很多人利用网络传播信息比较快的特点<br>举例： 一些不择手段的记者甚至编造故事，比如一些名人的婚外情，希望以此来吸引读者的注意力，追求名利。<br>词伙：source of information, digital news, spread information, distort facts, make up stories, extra-marital affairs, gain fame<br>翻译：Online news is not widely accepted as a reliable source of information since digital news is not well regulated. Everyone can spread information via social networking sites and Internet watchdogs do not have resources to check millions of new postings which are created on a daily basis. Some individuals or organisations also deliberately make use of network media which sometimes helps to spread news faster than print media.  This provides the possibility of distorting the facts. For example, some unscrupulous journalists even make up stories, such as extra-marital affairs of some celebrities, in hopes of attracting readers’ attention and gaining fame.</li>

It is difficult for an average person to visit different places to learn about the world, as they live a busy life.

</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>(知识)看新闻可能被误导。解释：可能因为政治压力或者商业利益，新闻故意扭曲事实或者捏造一些信息去误导读者。解释2：记者有自己的主观想法(由价值观、政治立场)，有些时候在报道新闻有失偏颇。 结果：对世界了解不准确。<br>词伙：manipulate the public, twist facts, make up fake news, distort view, political pressure, give a balanced account, biased views, personal values, political opinions<br>翻译：News sometimes can manipulate the public. News media may twist facts or even make up fake news to distort the audience’s view of some issues, possibly because news organisations are under political pressure or do that for commercial interests. Another reason is that reporters sometimes are not able to give a balanced account of news events since they have biased views-affected by their personal values and political opinions. As a consequence, people may not gain correct information by reading news.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>(自我提高)看新闻提升批判性思维。解释：不同的报纸对同一事件不同的描述、解读和分析，甚至褒贬不一，让人们知道一个事情不同角度分析，结论可能不同。 解释：知道世界不同国家对同一个事情处理方法，让我们知道对一个东西的看法多样性。结果：人们在阅读信息的时候会带着批判的眼光，不会盲目下结论，思考问题更加深入。<br>词伙：critical thinking skills, contrasting views, arrive at different conclusions, think deeply, leap to a conclusion<br>翻译：Reading news can improve critical thinking skills. News outlets can describe, interpret and analyse the same news events in different ways, and show contrasting views; therefore, people will understand that they may arrive at different conclusions when seeing an issue from different perspectives. Meanwhile, by reading or watching news, people may realise that a problem can be tackled by individuals, organisations or countries in diverse ways, and they will understand the importance of comparing different solutions.

<li>钱：国际投资可以帮助发展中国家繁荣发展。<br>背景：贫穷在许多发展中国家是一个长期存在的问题，<br>解释1：跨国企业通常是带着资本来的。他们可能会投资当地公司，给这些公司发展资金。<br>解释2： 一些跨国企业也可以设立子公司，通过增加税收促进当地社区的发展。<br>词伙：persistent problem, run subsidiaries, increase tax revenue<br>翻译：International investment can help developing countries thrive. Poverty is a persistent problem in many developing countries, and multinational enterprises normally arrive with capital. They may invest in local firms and give these companies cash for development. Some multinational businesses may also run subsidiaries, which may contribute to the development of local communities by increasing tax revenue.</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>生活标准：A 国际投资  B 提供就业机会  C 提高当地人的生活水平<br>(A-B) 跨国公司可能是世界各地不同行业的市场领导者，它们在经济上有能力在第三世界国家雇用成千上万的工人，以满足世界各地对其产品的需求。这些工作对于那些本地企业很少有国际影响力的社区来说非常重要<br>(B-C) 当地人有了更多的就业机会于是就有了更多赚钱提高生活水平的机会。<br>词伙：job opportunities, market leaders, financially capable, earn money<br>翻译：The large scale foreign investment provides a considerable number of job opportunities, which can improve the living standard of people of developing countries.  Multinational enterprises may be market leaders of different industries around the world, and they are financially capable of hiring tens of thousands of workers in third-world countries to satisfy the huge demand for their products worldwide. These jobs are important for communities where there are few local businesses having international presence. More locals in the developing countries can earn money to improve their living standard.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>知识: 外国投资还可以促进世界各地的知识和技术转让。<br>背景：发展中国家没有资金、人才库和创新系统，这可能是长期贫穷的结果。跨国企业通常带来技术，包括先进的机器、先进的管理技能和最先进的系统。<br>解释：当他们进入一个新的市场时，他们可以为当地人提供员工培训，并向这些国家的工人传授技能。<br>解释2：他们还在当地招聘经理，这样这些国家的人才也可以学到现代管理技能的知识。<br>结果：这可以帮助发展中国家赶上发达经济体。<br>词伙：transfer of knowledge, talent pool, sophisticated machines, management skills, staff training, advanced economies<br>翻译：Foreign investment can also facilitate the transfer of knowledge and technology around the world. Developing countries do not have funding, the talent pool and systems for innovations, possibly as a result of persistent poverty, but Multinational enterprises normally arrive with technology, including sophisticated machines, advanced management skills and state-of-the-art systems. When they enter a new market, they may provide locals with staff training and impart skills to workers of these countries. They also recruit managers locally, so talented people in these countries can acquire knowledge of modern management techniques as well. This can help developing countries catch up with advanced economies.</li>

<li>经济上：国际投资可能对发展中国家的经济发展产生负面影响。<br>背景：跨国公司在资金、管理技能和技术上都比本土竞争对手有优势。<br>解释：一些外国公司进入发展中国家可能会导致一些公司倒闭。<br>结果：随着国内公司破产，这些国家可能会依赖外国公司。大型国际企业的主导地位意味着它们可以任意定价。<br>结果2：更糟糕的是，如果外国公司从这些国家撤出投资，当地经济可能会崩溃。<br>词伙：foreign firms, go bankrupt, set prices, withdraw investment<br>翻译：International investment may have a negative impact on the economic development of developing countries. Multinational companies have advantages over local competitors in terms of capital, managerial skills and technology. The arrival of some foreign firms in developing countries may cause the shutdown of some companies. These countries may rely on foreign firms as domestic companies go bankrupt. The dominance of large international businesses means that they can set prices arbitrarily. Even worse, if foreign companies withdraw investment from these countries, the local economy can collapse.</li>

Financial aid, technological support and investment in infrastructure can help underdeveloped countries to grow the economy, as they can open factories to produce products and have ports, airports and roads to transport goods to different places. The economic prosperity of these poor countries can eventually drive the economic growth of rich nations as well, if they have strong economic ties.</li>

<li>健康。防止疾病的蔓延。 解释：很多国家很穷，没有基础医疗设施，疾病很容易蔓延。解释：全球化，人很容易去不同的地方，疾病会影响全世界。解释：提供医药、疫苗，提供一些医疗人员，有助于控制疾病，减少死亡率。<br>词伙：the spread of diseases. medical facilities, contain diseases, in a globalised world, medicine and medical aid, vaccines, medical staff, control/manage diseases/ keep … in check, reduce deaths/death toll<br>翻译：The provision of aid is also beneficial to well-being of citizens of all countries involved, as it can prevent the spread of some diseases. Some countries are extremely poor and short of medical facilities to contain some contagious diseases. Another problem is that in a globalised world, people can travel to different places easily, so one medical condition can affect the whole world easily. The supply of medicine and vaccines, and the work of medical staff of economically developed countries, can help manage some diseases and reduce the death toll.</li>

<li>生活标准：生活很贫困。解释：贫穷国家过分依赖援助，自己没有动力去发展经济，一旦没有了援助，这些国家会遇到很多的经济问题。解释：贫困国家的政治系统缺乏透明度，钱被贪污了，真正需要的人用不到。<br>词伙：incentive, lack transparency/ governance/ open political system, corrupt officials, misuse/embezzle<br>翻译：One disadvantage of delivering aid to impoverished countries is that it does not tackle poverty.

As countries agree on stronger alliances, companies which specialise in the development of green technology can export their practices to different countries, and governments can hold international conferences to exchange information about how to preserve the environment. Meanwhile， they can enter some international agreements to ensure that all member states are committed to environmental protection efforts.</li>

By establishing some joint ventures with local business partners, foreign firms can enter different markets easily because they can gain more information from the local people and have a better understanding of the target market. They can earn more revenue. In addition, removing trade barriers means that products and services can enter different countries to make more profits. Finally, These multinational companies have many competitive advantages in their products and serrvices, and business partnerships can combine strengths of different companies and increase their profit-making capacity.</li>

Foreign companies may shift their manufacturing base to underdeveloped countries and take advantage of loopholes of local environmental laws to exploit natural resources and take no action to deal with pollution. International trade also increases the need for transportation of products across the world, which can cause a sharp increase in emissions.</li>

People can go to countries where the target language is spoken, and develop proficiency in the foreign language by integrating with locals. One benefit of taking this approach is that learners may find the differences between textbooks and the language usage in real life.

<li>知识：旅游让人们造成对一些国家错误的看法，让他们加深误解。解释：呆的时间很短，看到一个东西进行一个猜测和判断，以偏概全，又没有足够的时间去纠正错误的看法。解释2：语言不通，用自己的文化知识去解释自己所看到的一些情况，也有可能产生误解，又不能够问当地人问题来纠正这种看法。这种错误的观念会影响交流和相处。<br>词伙：develop misconceptions, reinforce stereotypes, take a long vacation, make assumptions, correct misconceptions, langauge barriers, biased views<br>翻译：One problem of travelling abroad is that tourists may form some misconceptions about another country and a trip can possibly reinforce their stereotypes about the host country. They may not take a long vacation, and therefore, they tend to make assumptions or judgments based on what they see, and sometimes over-generalise. They have no time to correct misconceptions. Meanwhile, because of language barriers, they tend to interpret the customs and social norms of local communities by their own cultural knowledge. They are not able to communicate with locals to revisit their ideas. Their biased views can affect their communication with people from these countreis.</li>

Tourism is a source of revenue, which may draw attention to the value of some age-old traditions, such as traditional ways of preparing food and making handicrafts. This can reinforce the sense of cultural identity. As some communities attract more visitors than before, some of their traditions will grab attention of conservation groups. They are publicised by official websites of high-profile travel agencies and the diaries, blogs and travel books written by well-travelled persons.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>环境：有利于保护当地的环境。解释：旅游带来了收入，当地人慢慢放弃一些传统的谋生手段(减少对环境的破坏)。<br>词伙：protect the local environment, generate income, traditional livelihoods, reduce the environmental damage<br>翻译：If the revenue of tourism increases, it can help protect the local environment.

The food, dresses, festivals and even religions are among the interesting components of a culture, and if an ethnic group increases presence in a community, their culture is likely to influence locals.
